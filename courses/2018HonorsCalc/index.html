        <p>In this (IBL) class there will hardly be any lectures to prove things for you. Instead, you will prove the propositions yourself and explain your proofs to each other. The environment of an IBL classroom is <b>collaborative</b> and not competitive
          and the main goal is to have loads of fun while learning some amazing mathematics.</p>
        <p>We will meet during regular class hours on Monday and Wednesday when you'll be given problem sheets to solve. You are expected to form groups and solve the problems together, <b>but write the solutions by yourselves.</b> These solutions and some
          extra HW problems will be due on Friday when I'll be holding extended office hours.</p>

        You have an option of doing a reading project in this class. If you choose to do a project, I'll reduce the weight of the final exam for you.
        <!--The project will consist of some independent reading by you about anything vaguely related to calculus.
          Here are a few possible topics for the projects:
          <ul>
            <li>Uniform Convergence</li>
            <li>Construction of Reals, Axiom of Choice etc.</li>
            <li>Pathological functions, nowhere differentiable function, space filling curves etc.</li>
            <li>Compactness, Heine-Borel theorem etc.</li>
            <li> What is a measure? </li>
            <li>Fourier series, etc.</li>
          </ul>-->
        You are free to come up with your own topics. For the project you'll have to submit a written report at the end of the semester. The report should have a rigorous definition-theorem-proof structure.</p>
