    <p>The textbook for this class is <b>Calculus, 4th Edition, Spivak</b>. We'll use this book only as a reference, it is ok to have a different edition. I'll be assigning reading assignments from the book. The official syllabus can be found <a
        class="external-link" target="_blank" href="http://mathematics.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/62/2015/07/110.113HonorsSingleVariableCalculusSyllabus.pdf">here</a>. Info about office hours etc. can be found <a href="../../index.html">here</a>.</p>
    <p> This class will be structured in the mode of Inquiry Based Learning. There will hardly be any lectures to prove things for you. Instead, you will prove the propositions yourself and explain your proofs to each other. The environment of an
      IBL classroom
      is collaborative and not competitive. There are three primary goals for this class.
      <ul>
        <li>To learn Calculus.</li>
        <li>To learn how to write proofs.</li>
        <li>To learn how to learn Math by yourselves.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>The first half of the class will be very theoretical and focused on writing proofs, the second half will be focused on standard calculus techniques (while still doing some proofs).

            As we will primarily be using HW problems to build all the necessary theory, it will become extremely important to have a good set of notes to refer back to. So, you should take good notes while reading the book! The journal is nothing
            but a collection of your well-written
            notes. You'll be asked to submit your journal every few weeks.

      There are two kinds of projects that you can do.
      You should submit your work at the end of semester (<b><span style="color:red">due Dec 7</span></b>).
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>If you have never taken Calc 2 before or would like to review whatever you have learnt what feels like a century ago, I'll assign you problems from the Differentiation and Integration chapters when we get to them which you can solve and
        submit <strike>along with the HWs</strike> at the end of the semester. This way you don't just learn proofs but also learn/review the computational aspect of Calculus. <br> <br> </li>
      <li>You could read a mathematical topic related to Calculus that is typically not covered in a standard Calculus sequence. In this case, you'll have to submit a written report at the end of the semester. The report will have to be written in
        a Definition-Theorem-Proof format. Some examples include:
        <ul>
          <li>Topics from Real Analysis (Heine-Borel theorem etc.)</li>
          <li>Set Theory (construction of reals, axiom of choice etc.)</li>
          <li>Measure Theory (what is Measure?, construction of non-measurable sets etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        These are just some suggestions, you can come up with your own topics.
