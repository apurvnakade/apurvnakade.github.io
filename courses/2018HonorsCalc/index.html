    <p>The textbook for the class is <b>Calculus, 4th Edition, Spivak</b>. We'll only use this book as a reference. I'll not be assigning any problems from the book, so it is ok to have a different edition. The official syllabus can be found <a class="external-link"
        href="http://mathematics.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/62/2015/07/110.113HonorsSingleVariableCalculusSyllabus.pdf">here</a>. Info about office hours etc. can be found <a href="../../index.html">here</a>.</p>
    <p> This class will be structured in the mode of Inquiry Based Learning. There will hardly be any lectures to prove things for you. Instead, you will prove the propositions yourself and explain your proofs to each other. The environment of an IBL classroom
      is <b>collaborative</b> and not competitive and the main goal is to have loads of fun while learning some interesting mathematics.</p>

    <p>The first half of the course will be very theoretical and focused on writing proofs, the second half will be focused on standard calculus techniques (while still doing some proofs).

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>40% <br> Homeworks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
          <td>
            <p>All the theory will be developed through problems, essentially you'll learn everything in this class by doing HW. Each week's problem sets count as one homework, only the <b>top 10 homeworks</b> will be included in the final grade (so no late
              submissions).

          <td>
            <p>Class attendance is compulsory, if for some reason you are unable to come to class you need to let me know beforehand. In class, you'll either be discussing problems in groups or presenting your solutions to others.
            </p>

          <td>
            <p>
              The journal is nothing but a collection of your well-written notes. As we will primarily be using HW problems to build all the necessary theory, it will become extremely important to have a good set of notes to refer back to. You'll be asked to submit
              your journal every few weeks.

      <h3 class="">Optional Project</h3>
      <p>You have an option of doing a reading project in this class. If you choose to do a project, I'll reduce the weight of the final exam for you. You are free to come up with your own topics. For the project you'll have to submit a written report at
        the end of the semester. We'll discuss this in more detail around the "fall break".</p>
