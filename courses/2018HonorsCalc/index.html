        <p class="quote">“The only way to learn mathematics is to do mathematics.”</p>
        <p class="quote-ref">- Paul Halmos</p>
        <p>The textbook for the class is <b>Calculus, 3rd Edition, Spivak</b>. We'll only use this book as a reference. The official syllabus can be found <a class="external-link" href="http://mathematics.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/62/2015/07/110.113HonorsSingleVariableCalculusSyllabus.pdf">here</a>.</p>
        <p> This class will be structured in the mode of Inquiry Based Learning. In this class there will hardly be any lectures to prove things for you. Instead, you will prove the propositions yourself and explain your proofs to
          each other. The environment of an IBL classroom is <b>collaborative</b> and not competitive and the main goal is to have loads of fun while learning some interesting mathematics.</p>

        <p>The first half of the class with be very theoretical and focused on writing proofs, the second half will focus on more standard calculus techniques (while still doing some proofs). Following is a tentative list of topics to be covered:</p>

        <p><b>Class participation: </b> This is the largest chunk of your grade, hence attendance is compulsory. If you have a legitimate reason for not being able to attend a class, for eg. if you have caught the flu or if you need to go to Sweden to receive
          the Nobel prize, then you should let me know asap about your absence, preferably before the class. During the class:
          <ul>
            <li> You'll be expected to work in groups with others and solve that day's problems (as much as possible).</li>
            <li> You'll present your solutions to the rest of the class (we'll work on this).</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

          <p><b>Homeworks: </b> Homework will consist of two parts:
            <ul>
              <li>Each class you'll be handed a problem sheet to work on together, however, you're expected to write the solutions by yourselves. Written solutions will be <b>due at the beginning of class on Monday</b>.
              </li>
              <li>There will be reading assignments for the weekend. If you do not do the reading assignments you won't be able to do the problems in class and this will affect your class participation grade.</li>
            </ul>
            Each week's problem sets count as one homework, only the <b>top 10 homeworks</b> will be included in the final grade (so no late submissions).</p>

          <p><b>Final Exam: </b>We'll cross this bridge when we get to it.</p>

        You have an option of doing a reading project in this class. If you choose to do a project, I'll reduce the weight of the final exam for you.
        <!--The project will consist of some independent reading by you about anything vaguely related to calculus.
          Here are a few possible topics for the projects:
          <ul>
            <li>Uniform Convergence</li>
            <li>Construction of Reals, Axiom of Choice etc.</li>
            <li>Pathological functions, nowhere differentiable function, space filling curves etc.</li>
            <li>Compactness, Heine-Borel theorem etc.</li>
            <li> What is a measure? </li>
            <li>Fourier series, etc.</li>
          </ul>-->
        You are free to come up with your own topics. For the project you'll have to submit a written report at the end of the semester. The report should have a rigorous definition-theorem-proof structure.</p>
