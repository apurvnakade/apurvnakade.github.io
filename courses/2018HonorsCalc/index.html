        <p class="quote">“The only way to learn mathematics is to do mathematics.”</p>
        <p class="quote-ref">- Paul Halmos</p>
        <p>The textbook for the class is <b>Calculus, 4th Edition, Spivak</b>. We'll only use this book as a reference. The official syllabus can be found <a class="external-link" href="http://mathematics.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/62/2015/07/110.113HonorsSingleVariableCalculusSyllabus.pdf">here</a>.</p>
        <p> This class will be structured in the mode of Inquiry Based Learning. There will hardly be any lectures to prove things for you. Instead, you will prove the propositions yourself and explain your proofs to
          each other. The environment of an IBL classroom is <b>collaborative</b> and not competitive and the main goal is to have loads of fun while learning some interesting mathematics.</p>

        <p>The first half of the class with be very theoretical and focused on writing proofs, the second half will focus on more standard calculus techniques (while still doing some proofs). Following is a tentative list of topics to be covered:</p>

              This is the largest chunk of your grade, hence attendance is compulsory.
                In the class, you'll be presenting your proofs and solutions of the HW problems to the rest of the class.

        <h3 class="">Optional Project</h3>
        <p>You have an option of doing a reading project in this class. If you choose to do a project, I'll reduce the weight of the final exam for you.
        <!--The project will consist of some independent reading by you about anything vaguely related to calculus.
          Here are a few possible topics for the projects:
          <ul>
            <li>Uniform Convergence</li>
            <li>Construction of Reals, Axiom of Choice etc.</li>
            <li>Pathological functions, nowhere differentiable function, space filling curves etc.</li>
            <li>Compactness, Heine-Borel theorem etc.</li>
            <li> What is a measure? </li>
            <li>Fourier series, etc.</li>
          </ul>The report should have a rigorous definition-theorem-proof structure.-->
        You are free to come up with your own topics. For the project you'll have to submit a written report at the end of the semester. We'll discuss this in more details around the "fall break".</p>
