    <p>The textbook for the class is <b>Calculus, 4th Edition, Spivak</b>. We'll use this book only as a reference. I'll not be assigning any problems from the book, so it is ok to have a different edition. The official syllabus can be found <a
    class="external-link"
    target="_blank"
        href="http://mathematics.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/62/2015/07/110.113HonorsSingleVariableCalculusSyllabus.pdf">here</a>. Info about office hours etc. can be found <a href="../../index.html">here</a>.</p>
    <p> This class will be structured in the mode of Inquiry Based Learning. There will hardly be any lectures to prove things for you. Instead, you will prove the propositions yourself and explain your proofs to each other. The environment of an IBL classroom
      is collaborative and not competitive. There are three primary goals for this class.
      <ul>
        <li>To learn Calculus.</li>
        <li>To learn how to write proofs.</li>
        <li>To learn to read advanced Math textbooks.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>The first half of the class will be very theoretical and focused on writing proofs, the second half will be focused on standard calculus techniques (while still doing some proofs).

          <td>
            <p>All theory will be developed through problems, essentially you'll learn everything in this class by doing HWs. Each week's problem sets count as one homework, only the <b>top 10 homeworks</b> will be included in the final grade (so no
              late submissions). Homeworks will be due at the beginning of class on Monday.

          <td>
            <p>Class attendance is compulsory, if for some reason you are unable to come to class you should let me know beforehand. In class, you'll either be discussing problems in groups or presenting your solutions to others. I'll hand out the relevant
              problem sets at the beginning of each class. There will be reading assignments which you are expected to read over the weekend.

              As we will primarily be using HW problems to build all the necessary theory, it will become extremely important to have a good set of notes to refer back to. So, you should keep good notes! The journal is nothing but a collection of your well-written
              notes. You'll be asked to submit your journal every few weeks.

      <h3 class="">Optional Project</h3>
      <p>You have an option of doing a reading project in this class. If you choose to do a project, I'll reduce the weight of the final exam for you. You are free to come up with your own topics. For the project you'll have to submit a written report at
        the end of the semester. We'll discuss this in more detail around the "fall break".</p>
