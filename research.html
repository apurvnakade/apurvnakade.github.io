          Manifold Calculus
        </td>
        <td class="column-description">
          Manifold calculus analyses homotopy functors on a manifold by breaking up the manifold into small pieces and trying to glue back the entire functor using the value of the functor on the small pieces. This is a technique that tries to generalize the notion
          of excision (to <i>higher excision</i>) from classical algebraic topology.

          Homotopy Theory
        </td>
        <td class="column-description">
          This is the area of mathematics from which I derive most of my tools and techniques. Homotopy theory analyses objects upto perturbations. Homotopy theoretic invariants typically provide obstructions to existence of maps. But these also form the bridge
          between topology and algebra, and in some cases geometry. (<a href="../notes/index.html#homotopyTheoryNotes">Notes on Homotopy Theory</a>)

          Symplectic Topology</td>
        <td class="column-description">
          This the area of mathematics that I like the most but know the least about. Symplectic topology is <i>flexible</i> in that it has no local invariants but at the same time it also <i>rigid</i> in that it has several global invariants which provide
          obstructions to existence of maps. This dichotomy makes Symplectic topology uniquely mysterious and fascinating. I'm interested in applying techniques from homotopy theory to study questions in Symplectic topology.
