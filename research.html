        <td style="width: 500px">Manifold calculus analyses homotopy functors on a manifold by breaking up the manifold into small pieces and trying to glue back the entire functor using the value of the functor on the small pieces. This is a technique that tries to generalize
          the notion of excision (to <i>higher excision</i>) from classical algebraic topology. <br><br></td>

        <td style="width: 500px">Objects that arise in algebraic topology typically are highly structured i.e. they support a lot of multiplication like operations. These operations are best encoded in an operad. The gluing procedure for the manifold calculus for example is best
          described using the framed little discs operad. <br><br></td>

        <td style="width: 500px">This is the area of mathematics from which I derive most of my tools and techniques. Homotopy theory is a <i>soft</i> theory in that it analyses objects upto perturbations. Homotopy theoretic invariants typically provide obstructions to existence
          of maps. But these also form the bridge between topology and algebra. (<a href="./notes/index.html#homotopyTheoryNotes">Notes on Homotopy Theory</a>)

        <td style="width: 500px">This the area of mathematics that I like the most but I know the least about. Symplectic topology is <i>flexible</i> in that it has no local invariants but at the same time it also <i>rigid</i> in that it has several global invariants which provide
          obstructions to existence of maps. This dichotomy makes Symplectic topology uniquely mysterious and fascinating. I'm interested in applying techniques from homotopy theory to study questions in Symplectic topology.
