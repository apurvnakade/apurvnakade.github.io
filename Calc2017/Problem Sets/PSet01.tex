\section*{Day 1}

The hardest step in writing an $ \epsilon-\delta$ proof is the first step, once you know how to start the proof the rest is mechanical. \\

\begin{questions}
	\item Explain in your own words how the provisional definition is equivalent to the more rigorous $\epsilon-\delta$ definition of limit.

	\begin{description}
		\item[Provisional definition] The function $f$ approaches a limit $l$ near $a$ i.e. $\lim \limits _ {x \rightarrow a} f(x) = l$, if we can make $f(x)$ as close to $l$ as we like by requiring that $x$ be sufficiently close to, but unequal to, $a$.
		\item[$\epsilon-\delta$ definition] The function $f$ {approaches a limit} $l$ near $a$ i.e. $\lim \limits _ {x \rightarrow a} f(x) = l$, if for every $\epsilon > 0$ there is some $\delta > 0$ such that, for all $x$, if $0 < |x - a| < \delta$, then $|f(x) - l| < \epsilon$.
	\end{description}

	% \item Another very useful way to rewrite the $\epsilon - \delta$ definition is the following: The function $f$ {approaches a limit} $l$ near $a$, if for every $\epsilon > 0$ there is some $\delta > 0$ such that, for all $x$, if $0 < |h| < \delta$, then $|f(a + h) - l| < \epsilon$. \\
	Explain how this is equivalent to the standard $\epsilon-\delta$ definition.
	\item For each of the following functions $f$ and real numbers $a$,
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Guess the limit $L = \lim \limits _ {x \rightarrow a} f(x)$.
		\item Find a $\delta$ corresponding to $\epsilon = 0.1$ in the $\epsilon - \delta$ definition of limit.
		      % \item For a real number $L' \neq L$ explain why you cannot find any $\delta$ that will work.
		\item Find a $\delta$ corresponding to an arbitrary real number $\epsilon$ and \textbf{prove} that $L$ is indeed the limit.

		      \begin{enumerate}
		      	\item $f(x)=x+2, \hspace{10pt} a=0$
		      	\item $f(x)=7x+ 2, \hspace{10pt} a=0$
		      	\item $f(x)=x^2-2, \hspace{10pt} a=0$
		      	\item $f(x)=1/x, \hspace{10pt} a=1$
		      \end{enumerate}
	\end{itemize}
\end{questions}

Its tedious to use $ \epsilon-\delta $ proofs in practice, instead we use Theorem 2 and it's analogues.\\

\begin{questions}[resume]
	\item
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Let $ n$ be a positive integer. Prove that the function $f(x)=x^n$ is continuous at 0.

		\item Use Theorem 2 to prove that every polynomial $p(x)$ is continuous at 0.

		\item Prove that a function $ f(x)$ is continuous at $a$ if and only if the function $ g(x) = f(x + a)$ is continuous at $0$.

		\item Prove that $x^n$ is continuous at every real number $ a$.

		\item Use Theorem 2 to prove that every polynomial $p(x)$ is continuous at all real numbers.

		\item What are the real numbers at which the ratio of two polynomials $\dfrac{p(x)}{q(x)}$ is continuous?
	\end{itemize}


	\item Using the $\epsilon-\delta$ definition of limit to prove that if $\lim \limits _ {x \rightarrow a} f(x) = l$ and $\lim \limits _ {x \rightarrow a} g(x) = m$ then $$\lim \limits _ {x \rightarrow a} \left(f(x)- g(x)\right) = l-m$$
	

\end{questions}
Trigonometric functions, exponential functions and logarithms are continuous wherever they are defined. We will assume this fact without proof for now and come back to it later.

To understand continuity it is equally important to understand discontinuity.
\begin{questions}[resume]
	\item
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Determine, with proof, $\lim \limits_{x \rightarrow \infty} 1/x$.
		\item Prove that for no real number $l$ do we have $\lim \limits_{x \rightarrow 0^+} 1/x = l$.
	\end{itemize}

	\item For the function 	$$ f(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & \mbox{ if } x < 0 \\ 1 & \mbox{ otherwise }\end{cases}$$
	determine, with proof, the limits $ \lim \limits_{x \rightarrow 0^+}$, $ \lim \limits_{x \rightarrow 0^-}$. How will you answers change if we replace $ x<0$ by $ x\le 0$ in the definition of $ f(x)$?
	\item Prove that the function
	$$ f(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & \mbox{ if $ x$ is rational } \\ 1 & \mbox{ otherwise }\end{cases}$$
	is discontinuous everywhere. What can you say about the continuity of the function $ g(x) = x .f(x)$?

	\item Give examples to show that the following definitions of $\lim \limits _ {x \rightarrow a} f(x) = L$ are not correct. (Hint: Think graphically)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item For all $ \delta > 0$ there exists an $ \epsilon > 0$ such that if $ 0<|x-a|< \delta$ then $ |f(x) - L|< \epsilon$.
		\item For every $\epsilon > 0$ there is some $\delta > 0$ such that, for all $x$, if $|f(x) - L| < \epsilon$ then $0 < |x - a| < \delta$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{questions}
