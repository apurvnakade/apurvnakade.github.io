                <p>In the first week we'll learn how to write proofs. The HW (which will be handed out in class) involves reading the <b>first 5 pages <a href="http://zimmer.csufresno.edu/~larryc/proofs/proofs.html">at this link</a></b> and solving the problems
                  there. Throughout the course we'll be doing a lot of proof writing and this homework will be very useful to you.</p>

          <h2>Course Description</h2>
          <b><a href="http://mathematics.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/62/2015/07/110.113HonorsSingleVariableCalculusSyllabus.pdf">The official syllabus can be found here.</a></b> This course covers the topics typically covered in the standard Calc
          1 and Calc 2 courses. This is a VERY fast paced course as it covers two semesters worth of material in one and you also learn to write mathematical proofs. If you like being challenged and are curious and excited about maths this is the course
          for you. This course will be taught in the mode of Inquiry Based Learning (see below).


          <h2>Homeworks</h2> Homeworks are what make this course. There will be reading assignments to be read BEFORE every class. I'll hand out problem sets in each class which you'll discuss in small groups in class, write the solutions by yourselves and submit them
          on the following Monday. Depending on how far we get with the problem sets during the week each group will get a chance to present their solutions to the rest of the class.


          <h2>Grading Scheme</h2>
          <table align="center">
            <tr>
              <td>Class participation </td>
              <td>:</td>
              <td><b>30%</b></td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>Homeworks </td>
              <td>:</td>
              <td><b>40%</b></td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>Final Exam</td>

            </tr>
          </table>
          <p>Each week's problem sets count as one homework, only the top 10 homeworks will be included in the final grade.</p>

          <h2>IBL</h2>
          <p class="quote">“The only way to learn mathematics is to do mathematics.”</p>
          <p class="quote-ref">- Paul Halmos</p>In an IBL course there will hardly be any lectures to prove things for you. Rather, you will prove the propositions yourself and explain your proofs to each other. The IBL format fosters creativity and a deep understanding of
          the material. However, its success depends heavily on the students: you must be actively engaged and prepared for class every day.
