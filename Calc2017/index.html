          <h2>Course Description</h2>
          <b><a href="http://mathematics.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/62/2015/07/110.113HonorsSingleVariableCalculusSyllabus.pdf">The official syllabus can be found here.</a></b> This course covers the topics typically covered in the standard Calc
          1 and Calc 2 courses and you also learn to write mathematical proofs, as such this is a <b>VERY</b> fast paced course. If you like being challenged and are curious and excited about maths this is the course for you. You should not be taking
          this course simply to meet your course requirements or because of the 'honors' in the title of the course, in which case the standard calculus courses would be more appropriate. This course will be taught in the mode of Inquiry Based Learning.

          <h2>IBL</h2>
          <p class="quote">“The only way to learn mathematics is to do mathematics.”</p>
          <p class="quote-ref">- Paul Halmos</p>In an IBL course there will hardly be any lectures to prove things for you. Rather, you will prove the propositions yourself and explain your proofs to each other. The IBL format fosters creativity and a deep understanding of
          the material. However, its success depends heavily on the students: you must be actively engaged and prepared for class every day. On one hand this mode of learning is highly rewarding and provides a deep understanding of the subject, on the
          other hand it requires substantial self-study and a willingness to make lots of mistakes and learn from them. <br><br>You are also expected to listen to the ideas of other students and be respectful to them even if you think you have the 'correct'
          solution. The environment of an IBL classroom is <b>collaborative</b> and not competitive and the main goal is to have loads of fun while learning a lot of awesome maths.


          <h2>Homeworks</h2> Homeworks are what make this course. Your homework will consist of 4 parts:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Reading assignments: </b>You will be assigned parts of the book to be read BEFORE every class. These assignments are extremely crucial as there will not be any lectures and you'll be learning the subject by reading the book. You're not
              expected to have understood everything that you've read, but you're expected to make good notes and ask questions about it in class. If you skip this step you'll be completely lost in the class and almost certainly fall behind.</li>
            <li><b>Group discussions: </b>This is where most of the magic happens. In class instead of passively listening to a lecture you'll be actively discussing problems with other students in your group and learning the subject in a very hands-on manner.
            </li>
            <li><b>Presentations: </b>Depending on how far we get with the problem sets during the week each group will get a chance to present their solutions to the rest of the class.</li>
            <li><b>Writing: </b>You need to write the solutions to the problem sets <i>by yourselves</i>. Learning the language of mathematics is a crucial part of the learning process and like any other language you need a lot of practice and feedback to
              get good at it. </li>
          </ul>

          I'll hand out problem sets in each class which you'll discuss in small groups in class, write the solutions by yourselves and submit them on the following Monday.
