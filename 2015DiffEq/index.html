		<h3>Course overview </h3> See <a href="http://www.mathematics.jhu.edu/new/undergrad/courses.htm#110.302" target="_blank"> here </a> for the course description. I would recommend <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-03sc-differential-equations-fall-2011/index.htm"
		  target="_blank"> these course notes</a> for self-studying.






		<h3>Exams </h3> All the exams will be <b>in class</b>. There will be a quiz <b>every monday</b> at the beginning of the class. In the last week, possibly on the last day of the class we will have the final exam. All the exams will be cumulative.

		<h3>Homework Guidelines </h3>

		<div class="quote"> 'When I use a word,' Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, 'it means just what I choose it to mean, neither more nor less.'</div>
		<div class="quote-ref">- Through the Looking Glass</div>

		I'll try to upload 2-3 homeworks everyweek and they will be due within the next 1-2 days. The homeworks would be shorter in length that what you would get in a regular course. Please understand that this is a fast paced course and it is going to be very
		hard to catch up once you start lagging behind, partly for this reason you would be expected to do the homeworks asap.
		<br>
		<br> You are expected to write clear, legible, mathematically correct solutions to the homework problems. A person who knows just the definitions and basic calculus should be able to understand your solutions.
