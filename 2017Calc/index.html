          <h2><br>Course Description</h2>
          <b><a href="http://mathematics.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/62/2015/07/110.113HonorsSingleVariableCalculusSyllabus.pdf">The official syllabus can be found here.</a></b> This course covers the topics typically covered in the standard Calc
          1 and Calc 2 courses, and you will also learn to write mathematical proofs, as such this is a <b>VERY</b> fast paced course. If you like being challenged and are curious and excited about maths this is the course for you. You should not be taking
          this course simply to meet your course requirements or because of the "honors" in the title of the course. This course will be taught in the mode of Inquiry Based Learning.

          <h2>Inquiry Based Learning</h2>
          <p class="quote">“The only way to learn mathematics is to do mathematics.”</p>
          <p class="quote-ref">- Paul Halmos</p>
          <p>In this (IBL) course there will hardly be any lectures to prove things for you. Instead, you will prove the propositions yourself and explain your proofs to each other. The IBL format fosters creativity and a deep understanding of the material.
            However, its success depends heavily on the students: you must be actively engaged and prepared for class every day. On one hand this mode of learning is highly rewarding and provides great insights into the subject, on the other hand it requires
            substantial self-study and a willingness to make lots of mistakes and not be frustrated by them. </p>
          <p>You are also expected to listen to the ideas of other students and be respectful to them even if you think you have the "correct" solution. The environment of an IBL classroom is <b>collaborative</b> and not competitive and the main goal is
            to have loads of fun while learning some amazing mathematics.</p>
          <p><b>What does a typical class look like?</b> You come to the class having read the reading assignment and hopefully with lots of questions, we'll discuss your questions first, I'll then hand out the problem sheets which you'll solve in small
            groups, I'll roam around and help out wherever necessary.
            <i>You'll not be allowed to use laptops or other electronic devices in class</i>, so you need to bring either a hard copy of the book or more preferably your own handwritten notes to the class.</p>



          <h2>Homeworks</h2> Homeworks are what make this course. Your homework will consist of three parts:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Reading assignments: </b>You will be assigned parts of the book to be read BEFORE every class. These assignments are extremely crucial as there will not be any lectures and you'll be learning the subject by reading the book. You'll not
              be expected to have understood everything that you've read, but you'll be expected to make good notes and ask questions about it in class. If you skip this step you will likely be completely lost and almost certainly fall behind.
            </li>
            <li><b>Group discussions: </b>This is where most of the magic happens. In class instead of passively listening to a lecture you'll be actively discussing problems with other students and/or the instructor and learning the subject in a very hands-on
              manner.
            </li>
            <li><b>Writing: </b>You will be required to write the solutions to the problem sets <i>by yourselves</i>. Learning the language of mathematics is a crucial part of the learning process and like any other language you will need a lot of practice
              to get good at it. </li>
          </ul>

          I'll hand out problem sets in each class which you'll discuss in small groups, write the solutions by yourselves and submit them on the following <b>Friday</b>.
