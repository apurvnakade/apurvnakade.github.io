      <description>There is an official page on Active.com about what an unidentified charge of $79.95 on your bank statement means. How many such websites have you seen in your life? Here is a website that deceptively charges you hoping that you&amp;rsquo;re stupid enough to not check your credit card statement. Apparently, Active.com is one of the most successful marathon event registration website and it is popular even though this scam is extremely well known.</description>

      <description>Being an Indian means that I&amp;rsquo;ve to apply for a visa even for short visits when travelling internationally. This is usually a small loss of money and time and I&amp;rsquo;ve never had any trouble with this process. That was until I applied for a Canadian visa in the US.
The Canadian government (fucking idiots) has outsourced the visa application process to a third party. These people are fucking morons incapable of making a sensible website and having the most arcane methods of application.</description>
