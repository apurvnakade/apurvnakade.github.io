What? Is? This? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDlzWH1wgJA">Movie?</a></p>

<p>Imagine watching the climax of a Charlie Chaplin or a Three Stooges movie as a kid; people are running helter-skelter all over the place, things get so chaotic that you have no idea as to what is going on, your eyes are constantly jumping from one character to another unable to keep up with the ongoing chaos; and yet you are on the edge of your seat with a foolishly wide grin stuck to your face which stubbornly refuses to shut, and it&rsquo;s only when dust settles and you sink back into your seat bursting out uncontrollably laughing that you realize you had forgotten to breathe.</p>

<p>Now take this climax, replace the actors with beautiful Japanese animated characters, stretch it into a full length film, add a few beautiful love stories to the mix, add sound and music, add so much color that the colors themselves become the protagonists as they sing and dance across the blitzing canvas, and make the director a completely mental person. That&rsquo;s what <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_night_is_short_walk_on_girl/">The Night Is Short, Walk On Girl</a> is like.</p>

<p>When the movie credits at the end started rolling my mind was completely blank with the shock of what I had just seen. I and my friend silently left the theater, stepped out into the bright lights, took one look at each other and immediately fell over laughing, neither of us had any idea of what had just happened.</p>

<p>The entire movie is a bedazzling fever dream, whose dream I cannot tell. It&rsquo;s a moment of reckless madness unfurling in a single night. The imagination of its creator is like nothing I&rsquo;ve ever seen before, an imagination so bizarre, so childish and yet so mature. It&rsquo;s a movie about innocent love, in a world devoid of worries, about dreams, about taking chances, about the foolish life, about adolescence, about living in the moment, about dreaming and connecting and not caring, and caring, intensely, vibrantly, fully.</p>

<p>I cannot help but share one of my favorite clips from the movie. Enjoy.
