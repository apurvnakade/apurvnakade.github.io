<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What happens when people open their hearts?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;They get better.” <br>
<em>- Norwegian Wood</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Norwegian Wood</em> is a teenage love story/coming of age story set mainly in Tokyo and the mountains of Kyoto. The name derives from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiJiuhnDfck">eponymous song</a> by the Beatles.</p>

<p>I have very mixed feelings about the book. On one hand, the book has a very pulp feeling to it. There are too many sex scenes described with unnecessary details (the scenes aren&rsquo;t even interesting, just teenagers jerking each other off) and every conversation between the protagonists eventually converges towards sex, love, and masturbation. The protagonists are all immature teenagers mostly self-centered and suffering from the ever so familiar teenage angst.</p>

<p>On the other hand, interspersed between these moments of promiscuity are moments of death and sadness, one learns about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_in_Japan">suicide epidemic</a> in Japan, the detachment of the youth from the society. The teenage protagonists in this book see more death in a span of a few years than can be possible healthy for them. Suicide seems almost like a career choice, something to do when you think you need a change in life.</p>

<p>The main protagonist, Toru Watanabe, is a very ordinary loser college student, innocent, lacking ambition, depressed and lonely for most part of the book, falling in and out of love with two girls in his life in a really complicated manner. The poor guy&rsquo;s life in Tokyo starts casually and before long gets completely out of hand and extremely tangled thanks to these two girls, who themselves lead extremely convoluted lives. <em>Cherchez la femme</em>.</p>

<p>The book is very poetic, the name of the book is after all inspired by a Beatles song. Murakami describes the travels in Tokyo, the bus rides in Kyoto, Toru&rsquo;s college dormitory life, the season&rsquo;s of Japan, with the gentleness and flair of an impressionist painter. A lot of conversations are about sex and love, but they&rsquo;re also very honest and sincere. Toru is a non-judging person and hence a perfect observer and listener, a person to whom everybody else seems to speak their minds freely, and every few pages there would be a deeply incisive and insightful statement about the human nature.</p>

<p>I used to listen to a lot of Beatles songs but I only ever paid attention to their musical qualities and listened for their entertainment value. But after reading this book I now have a greater appreciation of the Beatles, I now think of them as more than musicians, I now understand better why they were so popular, why their music affected so many. When you read this book you feel the same gentleness you feel when listening to &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-dONCnY_Yg">My Guitar gently weeps</a>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4hTUPFBaaQ">Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds</a>&rdquo;, reading this book makes you acutely aware of it.</p>

<p>You should read this book for it&rsquo;s staggering honesty and it&rsquo;s vulnerable and deeply flawed protagonists. It is a story without a moral, a poetry without reason.</p>
