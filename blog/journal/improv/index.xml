      <description>Laban categorized human movement into four component parts:
 Space Time Weight Flow  Each of those parts has two elements:
 Space is either direct or indirect. Speed is either quick or sustained. Weight is either heavy or light. Flow is either bound or free.  In class, we mainly focused on the eight efforts.
            PUNCH Direct Quick Heavy Bound   PRESS Direct Sustained Heavy Bound   SLASH Indirect Quick Heavy Free   WRING Indirect Sustained Heavy Bound   DAB Direct Quick Light Bound   FLICK Indirect Quick Light Free   FLOAT Indirect Sustained Light Free   GLIDE Direct Sustained Light Free    Reference: https://somersetacademy.</description>

      <description>We learnt about the various stock characters in the old Italian troupe of Comedia dell&amp;rsquo;arte. The goal is to express a character using their physical mannersisms and try and use these characteristics in your act.
 Pantalone A suspicious miser. He is always hunched over, bent head, conniving, hands hidden and close to the chest. He walks slowly . He speaks in a rough hoarse voice without every looking up. He steps toe first, with slow high soft steps.</description>
