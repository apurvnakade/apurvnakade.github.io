      <description>Life is profoundly sad. It is filled with loneliness, with regrets, lost chances, sad memories, words you can never take back, friends you&amp;rsquo;ll never see again, fractured pieces of your Self floating across the ocean of Life.
But on the stage, you forget. You forget the profundity and the seriousness. You forget the consequences.
On the stage, you are performing. You perform so that you can smile, at yourself, in secret, at the one moment you once lived when you were a completely different person, or for once, truly yourself.</description>

      <title>Short Form</title>

      <description>Short form improv is the most popular form of improv, thanks to shows like Whose Line is it Anyway?. In some ways sketch comedy like SNL is closer to Short Form than Long Form.
Short form scenes are shorter (2 mins) with a much stricter structure and hence short form improv is easy to perform on television. Further the structure and the premise is already established and conveyed to the audience at the beginning of the scene, much like in sports.</description>

      <description>This 301 class is about game, the backbone of all Improv scenes.
We talked about the importance of setting up the base reality. We started with a warm up called the Robot Game. This game involves two people and these are the only lines they&amp;rsquo;re allowed to say
 Player 1:  I am ... 
Player 2:  I am ... 
Player 1:  We are at ...</description>

      <title>Character as Game</title>
      <link>https://apurvnakade.github.io/blog/journal/improv/character-as-game/</link>

      <description>We talked about how it is possible to play a character that is either
 close to you, completely opposite of you.  Both are completely valid options to play. And by making choices for what character to play, the character itself can become the game in the scene.
The important thing is to make strong choices and have strong beliefs, without which the character becomes both hard to believe and unplayable as a game.</description>

      <description>VAPAPO is a character creation technique created by Jill Bernard, the author of Small Cute Book of Improv. 
Voice Atittude Posture Animal Prop Obsession  The idea of VAPAPO is that by strongly choosing each of the 6 traits it is possible to create an entirely unique character in each scene. Further, these choices are indepedent of the scene and can be made beforehand thereby making a very colorful scene.</description>

      <description>Laban categorized human movement into four component parts:
 Space Time Weight Flow  Each of those parts has two elements:
 Space is either direct or indirect. Speed is either quick or sustained. Weight is either heavy or light. Flow is either bound or free.  In class, we mainly focused on the eight efforts.
            PUNCH Direct Quick Heavy Bound   PRESS Direct Sustained Heavy Bound   SLASH Indirect Quick Heavy Free   WRING Indirect Sustained Heavy Bound   DAB Direct Quick Light Bound   FLICK Indirect Quick Light Free   FLOAT Indirect Sustained Light Free   GLIDE Direct Sustained Light Free    Reference: https://somersetacademy.</description>

      <title>Commedia dell&#39;arte</title>

      <description>We learnt about the various stock characters in the old Italian troupe of Comedia dell&amp;rsquo;arte. The goal is to express a character using their physical mannersisms and try and use these characteristics in your act.
 Pantalone A suspicious miser. He is always hunched over, bent head, conniving, hands hidden and close to the chest. He walks slowly . He speaks in a rough hoarse voice without every looking up. He steps toe first, with slow high soft steps.</description>

      <description>We played some theater games to learn how to not get self conscious while on the stage and be more aware and have a better stage presence.
