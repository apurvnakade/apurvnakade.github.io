  <div class="post"><p>This 301 class is about <em>game</em>, the backbone of all Improv scenes.</p>

<p>We talked about the importance of setting up the <em>base reality</em>.
We started with a warm up called the <strong>Robot Game</strong>.
This game involves two people and these are the only lines they&rsquo;re allowed to say</p>

<blockquote>
Player 1: <i> I am ... </i><br>
Player 2: <i> I am ... </i><br>
Player 1: <i> We are at ... </i><br>
Player 2: <i> We are doing ... </i><br>
Player 1: <i> I feel ... because ...</i><br>
Player 2: <i> I feel ... because ... </i> 
</blockquote>

<p>All three lines should be unrelated to each other.
For example, if you&rsquo;re a doctor you should not be in a hospital, if you are at a gym you should not be doing something other than working out. The reason for this constraint is that the first few lines in a scene set up the base reality, and we want the base reality to be broader so as to give us more things to play with.</p>

<p>The next game we played was <strong>No Questions</strong>.
In this game, two people start a scene and the rule is that <em>you are not allowed to ask questions</em>.
Every time a player asks a questions he is replaced by another player from the backline.
Asking questions in a scene in improv is lazy acting, it puts a lot of pressure on our partner and pushes the responsibility back to them.
We ask a lot of questions without actually consciously thinking about them, the role of this game is to make you aware of that.</p>

<p>Not to say that questions are not allowed in a scene. However, a question should also provide our partner with some information thereby advancing the scene further.</p>

<p>Finally, we practiced playing two person scenes involving a <strong>Weirdo</strong> and a <strong>Voice of Reason</strong>.
In these kinds of games, one of the players makes a very strong emotional choice triggered by a very minor incident.
While the reaction should be surprising, it should not be entirely irrational and should be <strong>justified</strong> by some person belief.
This then becomes the <strong>game</strong> i.e. the weird thing in the scene.
The voice-of-reason&rsquo;s job is to calm the weirdo down and take the game away from the weird thing and <strong>rest the scene</strong>.</p>

<p>The belief should be both <strong>broad</strong> and <strong>specific</strong>.</p>
