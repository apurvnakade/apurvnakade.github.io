      <description>It is quite an everyday thing to be stuck in a plane on a tarmac at the Denver airport awaiting it&amp;rsquo;s turn to get on the runway. It is, however, not an everyday thing to have your plane get bombarded by huge hailstones while it is there. At first it sounds like some firecrackers are going off in a distance, until you listen closely and realize that the sounds are coming from all over the plane, until finally you look out to witness the scary sight of hail making your plane incapable of flying.</description>

      <description>It was the last day of the camp. All the campers were leaving out in busses and cars, being chaperoned off by the staff to the airport at various times during the day. As had been normal for quite a few days now (or was it weeks?), I had slept for 5-6 hours the previous night and yet was wide awake for my driving shifts.
In a comedy of errors, in the morning I had dropped a camper off whose parents had completely bungled up the departure plan.</description>
