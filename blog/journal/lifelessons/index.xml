      <description>I used to love watching Ted Talks, but of late I think the institution has very much lost its way and its originality and has become overly preachy and full of generic platitudes. It is great then to come across a Ted talk that I feel happy to share.
  It has helped me a lot during my grad school to be able to adapt my research as needed. It took me a while, but I eventually figured out that I am not very keen on proving grand conjectures but prefer working on small projects.</description>
