      <description>I was attending the Science of Learning Symposium at JHU, which is usually quite fascinating, but was very boring this year. These are the things that frustrate me about formal events:
 People take extended time to introduce the speakers (nobody wants to hear you talk, go away). People in suits, usually senior professors who have stopped being scientists, who think they&amp;rsquo;re funny because nobody is honest to them, make shitty jokes and laugh at their own jokes.</description>

      <description>I have had glasses ever since I was 10 years old. As a kid I used to wear really thick durable plastic frames, which evolved to metal frames in my teenage years, and then back to durable plastic frames in college. My power used to increase incessantly until I stopped growing and so I&amp;rsquo;ve probably paid a visit to an ophthalmologist every single year of my life in India. Today for the first time I went for an eye check-up in the US.</description>

      <title>Getting Things Done</title>

      <description>These are some notes I took from the book Getting Things Done by David Allen. Let me first start with the cons of the book. First the book is tediously repetitive, while some repetition is good to drill the concepts deep in your mind, the book overdoes it. Second, the book is clearly intended for people who&amp;rsquo;ve white collar jobs, mostly managers and executives.
But that does not mean that you cannot gatecrash the party.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;In the broad light of day mathematicians check their equations and their proofs, leaving no stone unturned in their search for rigour. But, at night, under the full moon, they dream, they float among the stars and wonder at the miracle of the heavens. They are inspired. Without dreams there is no art, no mathematics, no life.&amp;rdquo; -Michael Atiyah
 I finally finished my week long class on the ideas behind Galois&amp;rsquo; proof of why a quintic cannot be solved using radicals.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen Paddington, and frankly the only reason I decided to watch Paddington 2 is because of it&amp;rsquo;s insanely high ratings on Rotten Tomatoes.
The ratings are not exaggerated. This is a beautifully made movie, everything about this movie is good.
  I&amp;rsquo;ll only say this, watching this movie is not unlike reading a Harry Potter book (Hagrid is in the movie!). The story is tactfully written, as if by Rowling herself, but much more cheerful, without any hint of an underlying sadness.</description>

      <description>I came home today from the gym all sweaty and smelly and quite content. As I threw my bags on the bed and settled down, I had a great urge to open up my laptop and check something online. Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been becoming increasing aware of this internet addiction that seems more and more unavoidable.
I resisted and just laid myself down on my bed staring at the ceiling. Perhaps for the first time I noticed how beautifully the walls of my house are painted.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;What happens when people open their hearts?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;They get better.‚Äù - Norwegian Wood
 Norwegian Wood is a teenage love story/coming of age story set mainly in Tokyo and the mountains of Kyoto. The name derives from the eponymous song by the Beatles.
I have very mixed feelings about the book. On one hand, the book has a very pulp feeling to it. There are too many sex scenes described with unnecessary details (the scenes aren&amp;rsquo;t even interesting, just teenagers jerking each other off) and every conversation between the protagonists eventually converges towards sex, love, and masturbation.</description>

      <description>Guillermo del Toro&amp;rsquo;s best work is undoubtedly Pan&amp;rsquo;s Labyrinth, a bittersweet dreamlike tale of a young girl who finds herself in the unknown forests of Spain.
This new movie of his, Shape of Water, in some ways tries to recreate the same feel. The premise is completely different but the setting is exactly as in Pan&amp;rsquo;s Labyrinth. There is an unfortunate damsel with evil parents/bosses who comes in contact with magical creatures and finds an escape from &amp;ldquo;reality&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>In conclusion I&amp;rsquo;ve spent 2 days at the Everglades, 1 day at the Biscayne National Park, 1 day at the Miami beach and 1 day mostly driving. Because of the cold coming from the storm I could not do many of the standard things but on the bright side there were no mosquitoes. I could have done a few things better but most things were out of my control, again thanks to the weather.</description>

      <description>The Biscayne National Park visitor center is by the sea of course and is at the end of a serene Biscayne boulevard. There are sailing ships and motor boats marooned at the piers and the water is pristine blue. Close to the shore are the red mangroves trees, apparently the entire Biscayne National Park was a part of the Everglades not too long ago before the water levels rose. The waters right next to the shore are slow zones because apparently manatees (which are endangered now) like to congregate here and are likely to get damaged by careless boats.</description>

      <description>The next day I drove early morning to Shark Valley. This visitor center is at the center of what are called the historical Everglades but now it is practically the northern entrance. There is a single 15 mile biking trail at this visitor center. You can rent a bike for $9 per hour which is what I did. Along the way to Shark Valley you can see a lot of airboat tour advertisement which I was tempted to try, but because of the cold it was unlikely that I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to see much.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;There are no other Everglades in the world.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;The Everglades: River of Grass 
 I woke up at 5:45am, determined to make the most out of the first day of the year. It was dark and hazy outside when I started heading towards the Everglades on US-1. As you exit US-1 the traffic starts dwindling until you reach a long single lane street passing through the massive lush green South Floridian agricultural lands.</description>

      <description>Already my friends are posting new year wishes on facebook, in the first half of the world the calendars have been renewed and a nascent year has taken it&amp;rsquo;s first breath.
 Sunset at BWI   I&amp;rsquo;m watching the planes take off at the Baltimore airport against the setting sun, the morning snow is still littered on the ground making half the hanger appear white.
My plane has elegantly attached itself to the gate, like a peck on the cheek.</description>

      <description>An Area of Darkness is a disturbing pessimistic novel written by V.S. Naipaul about his first visit to India in 1962. This was India not too long after the Independence with it&amp;rsquo;s freshly minted Constitution, trying to make a transition from an English past to an Indian future. Naipaul shares the sentiments of West, the tone of the book is not unlike Slumdog Millionaire (a very unpopular movie in India).</description>

      <description>Thinking, Fast and Slow in a life changing book written by our lord and savior Daniel Kahneman, Danny Kanny.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read this book you should drop everything that you&amp;rsquo;re doing and start reading it right away. It is extremely well written and easy to read, with short chapters and lucid Hemingway-styled language lacking any pretentiousness.
Danny Kanny posits a two system model for our minds. The faster system which is also the system truly in charge, Mr.</description>

      <description>‚ÄúThe choice for mankind lies between freedom and happiness and for the great bulk of mankind, happiness is better.‚Äù - 1984
Icarus is a shocking film about an American filmmaker getting accidentally intertwined with head of the Russian anti-doping lab, Rodchenkov, during the unfolding of the Russian doping scandal. It starts out with the juxtaposition of Lance Armstrong&amp;rsquo;s testimonies before and after his conviction of guilt, and that sets the tone for the rest of the film.</description>

      <description>Goo watch Jumanji. I&amp;rsquo;ve now become a fan of Kevin Hart after watching this movie. There is no sarcasm, no deadpan humor, nothing vulgar, nothing GTA-Hangover style, nobody ever makes fun of anybody else, all the humor is benignly self-deprecating. It&amp;rsquo;s a heartwarming, wholesome, adventurous, gripping, innocent movie. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure nobody says fuck or shit in the movie even once. And it&amp;rsquo;s still funny. I know! Who would have thought?</description>

      <description>I love words.
I found this wholesome link on Reddit while I was doing some work (*cough*). As the US is riling under Mr. Pai&amp;rsquo;s proud accomplishments there are some countries that have figured it all out.
 Every year since 1944, the Icelandic book trade has published a catalogue ‚Äì called B√≥kat√≠√∞indi (‚ÄòBook Bulletin‚Äô, in English) ‚Äì that is sent to every household in the country in mid-November during the Reykjavik Book Fair.</description>

      <description>Zugzwang
 (n.) a situation in which the obligation to make a move in one&amp;rsquo;s turn is a serious, often decisive, disadvantage, often in the final years of grad school.
 Zugzywangy.
  I don&amp;rsquo;t understand music and yet I like to listen to it, same goes with girls. I recently came across this video on youtube where the guy describes chess games and it&amp;rsquo;s fun to watch even without knowing anything about chess.</description>

      <description>Saturdays are the hardest for me, I have an early morning yoga class. And so every Saturday morning there is almost always an intense battle between the sleep-a-little-more and the get-your-ass-up factions. Both sides have fairly convincing arguments and the debate turns deeply philosophical pretty quickly. Fortunately the get-your-ass-up faction always wins as by then I&amp;rsquo;m wide awake and can&amp;rsquo;t possibly go back to sleep. Nice strategy!
As I stumble outside half asleep half awake trying to make it in time, I&amp;rsquo;m pleasantly surprised by the small aimlessly drifting snow flakes, taking their time dancing in the wind before melting away on the wet pavement.</description>

      <description>One of the perks of being at Hopkins is that ever so often you get to visit the Hubble Space Telescope building. It is a stolid building perched atop a small slope on the fringe of the campus overlooking a dense park through which flows calmly a small ravine, or a run, as we like to call it in this part of the world.
There isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly much to see here, the telescope being in outer Space and all that, but there is a friendly cafeteria with large glass windows serving Central American food.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m usually very reluctant to try new places. I do enjoy the places AFTER I&amp;rsquo;ve been to them, the trouble lies with the planning phase. While there are several reviews available online none of them talk about, for example, how long does it take to get to Hopkins from the place? Or how sunny does it get at 3pm on a Sunday in December? None of the reviews, in short, provide any useful information to a graduate student.</description>

      <description>I spent the entire day today configuring Hugo so that I can write a blog. The alternative was of course using the free, efficient, easy to use, readily configurable blog sites. What be life without a little pain?
In my college I owned a shitty Acer laptop with an utterly useless battery and a cooling system so bad that the fan would act as a noise cancelling device for the din outside.</description>
