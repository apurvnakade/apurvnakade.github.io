      <description>HBO is bringing out a remixed version of the Watchmen and it brings back some very fond memories.
When I first saw Zack Snyder&amp;rsquo;s Watchmen I had never heard of Alan Moore or Neil Gaiman. I had seen Snyder&amp;rsquo;s flashy, extreme slo-moed, over the top 300 which, if nothing else, was an enjoyable watch. I did enjoy watching Watchmen too, but unlike 300, Watchmen was a revolutionary movie for me as it introduced me to the genre of graphic novels.</description>

      <title>Giving a Math Talk</title>

      <description>I recently saw this fun video about the tension between clarity and mystery and the role of this tension in creating good design. It made me think about giving a math talk.
I think this element is often neglected when one prepares a math class or just a math talk.
It is understood that unlike, say, in fiction, mystery is inevitable and undesirable in mathematics. While it is good to have a bunch of unsolved problems to work on, we would very much like to know the answers to them.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t used any Microsoft product since I came to the US. I fleetingly toyed with the idea of using Windows 10 but having seen the glory days of Windows 98 I just could not tolerate this monstrosity.
I stumbled upon this article about the silent resurgence of Microsoft as the world&amp;rsquo;s most valuable company and the article for some reason made me a tad bit happy.
Growing up in India, Apple was not a concept I was even vaguely aware of.</description>

      <description>Sherlock Holmes was perhaps one of the first non-school books I have ever read. My first books were goosebumps, nancy drew, hardy boys and then I graduated to Sherlock Holmes and LOTR.
I mostly read Sherlock in the summer, when I would have a lot of free time and would often be traveling to see my extended family in the hot and sunny rural India, where there would be no electricity and no TV.</description>

      <description>Never buy an Apple product which is not in stock. I made this mistake and it took over a month to get this Macbook Air and its not even the greatest model in the world. This would have been fine had they told me it was going to take a week to get the laptop, but instead every 3-4 days they would send me an email saying that for certain unforeseeable reasons the shipment is delayed but you should expect to get it real soon.</description>

      <title>On the stage of Improv</title>

      <description>Life is profoundly sad. It is filled with loneliness, with regrets, lost chances, sad memories, words you can never take back, friends you&amp;rsquo;ll never see again, fractured pieces of your Self floating across the ocean of Life.
But on the stage, you forget. You forget the profundity and the seriousness. You forget the consequences.
On the stage, you are performing. You perform so that you can smile, at yourself, in secret, at the one moment you once lived when you were a completely different person, or for once, truly yourself.</description>

      <title>Russian Doll</title>

      <guid>https://apurvnakade.github.io/blog/art/series/russian-doll/</guid>
      <description>Russian Doll is a modern day interpretation of the Groundhog Day. While the theme itself is quite clich√© and played out, Russian Doll brings in Netflix&amp;rsquo;s awesome production to create a mostly enjoyable series. With eight short episodes this is basically the length of a long movie, perfect length which prevents the series from feeling draggy. It&amp;rsquo;s short enough that it does not have to delve deeply into philosophy but long enough for the characters to evolve organically.</description>

      <title>Short Form</title>

      <guid>https://apurvnakade.github.io/blog/journal/improv/shortform/</guid>
      <description>Short form improv is the most popular form of improv, thanks to shows like Whose Line is it Anyway?. In some ways sketch comedy like SNL is closer to Short Form than Long Form.
Short form scenes are shorter (2 mins) with a much stricter structure and hence short form improv is easy to perform on television. Further the structure and the premise is already established and conveyed to the audience at the beginning of the scene, much like in sports.</description>

      <description>&#34;Weakness and ignorance are not barriers to survival, but arrogance is.&#34; -Three Body Problem  Of the Three Body Problem trilogy, I immensely enjoyed reading the first book and had to drag my way across the other two.
The first book has a very beautiful structure. It is intensely gripping with very honest, well-formed characters, it jumps across various timelines introducing us to the Chinese cultural revolution along the way, has a whodunit mystery, creates great sci-fi worlds - a complete package.</description>

      <description>This 301 class is about game, the backbone of all Improv scenes.
We talked about the importance of setting up the base reality. We started with a warm up called the Robot Game. This game involves two people and these are the only lines they&amp;rsquo;re allowed to say
 Player 1:  I am ... 
Player 2:  I am ... 
Player 1:  We are at ...</description>

      <title>Character as Game</title>

      <guid>https://apurvnakade.github.io/blog/journal/improv/character-as-game/</guid>
      <description>We talked about how it is possible to play a character that is either
 close to you, completely opposite of you.  Both are completely valid options to play. And by making choices for what character to play, the character itself can become the game in the scene.
The important thing is to make strong choices and have strong beliefs, without which the character becomes both hard to believe and unplayable as a game.</description>

      <description>VAPAPO is a character creation technique created by Jill Bernard, the author of Small Cute Book of Improv. 
Voice Atittude Posture Animal Prop Obsession  The idea of VAPAPO is that by strongly choosing each of the 6 traits it is possible to create an entirely unique character in each scene. Further, these choices are indepedent of the scene and can be made beforehand thereby making a very colorful scene.</description>

      <description>This movie is Rashomon meets Oldboy meets a Tinto Brass.
There is something disturbing about Korean thriller films. It&amp;rsquo;s perhaps exaggerated by my lack of knowledge of the Korean culture, it feels very alien, disconnected, happenning in a shadow world, fragmented, a snowstorm in a crystal ball.
In The Handmaiden this is further amplified by the setting. The movie starts with a scene in a poverty-riden Korean, immediately contrasted with a serene dreamlike scene following a lonely car through a famous-five island, on a curving road, through through woods and darkness and distictly Japanese gardens.</description>

      <description>Laban categorized human movement into four component parts:
 Space Time Weight Flow  Each of those parts has two elements:
 Space is either direct or indirect. Speed is either quick or sustained. Weight is either heavy or light. Flow is either bound or free.  In class, we mainly focused on the eight efforts.
            PUNCH Direct Quick Heavy Bound   PRESS Direct Sustained Heavy Bound   SLASH Indirect Quick Heavy Free   WRING Indirect Sustained Heavy Bound   DAB Direct Quick Light Bound   FLICK Indirect Quick Light Free   FLOAT Indirect Sustained Light Free   GLIDE Direct Sustained Light Free    Reference: https://somersetacademy.</description>

      <description>What? Is? This? Movie?
Imagine watching the climax of a Charlie Chaplin or a Three Stooges movie as a kid; people are running helter-skelter all over the place, things get so chaotic that you have no idea as to what is going on, your eyes are constantly jumping from one character to another unable to keep up with the ongoing chaos; and yet you are on the edge of your seat with a foolishly wide grin stuck to your face which stubbornly refuses to shut, and it&amp;rsquo;s only when dust settles and you sink back into your seat bursting out uncontrollably laughing that you realize you had forgotten to breathe.</description>

      <description>We learnt about the various stock characters in the old Italian troupe of Comedia dell&amp;rsquo;arte. The goal is to express a character using their physical mannersisms and try and use these characteristics in your act.
 Pantalone A suspicious miser. He is always hunched over, bent head, conniving, hands hidden and close to the chest. He walks slowly . He speaks in a rough hoarse voice without every looking up. He steps toe first, with slow high soft steps.</description>

      <description>&#34;The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.&#34; -Neuromancer  I always knew that The Matrix had to have found it&amp;rsquo;s concepts from some book, it was too revolutionary a movie to have spawned out of nothing. And I finally found it - Neuromancer, the archetypal cyberpunk novel.
This is probably the hardest and simultaneously the most riveting sci-fi novel I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read.</description>

      <description>&#34;I know what I&#39;m about son.&#34;  Ron Swanson is the simply the best Swanson.
I watch all kinds of comedy and I love all kinds of comedy. Good comedians are great philosophers who bring out the absurdities in life. They&amp;rsquo;re great observers, great listeners, great communicators, great actors, and great thinkers.
Good comedians extract humor out of the simplest of things. Ron Swanson finds it in silence. While many comedians are loud, energetic, emphatic, expressive and do great caricature, Ron manages to be funny by not doing anything, a master of deadpan comedy, he&amp;rsquo;s the punctuation marks in the otherwise unpunctuated soliloquies of Leslie Knopes.</description>

      <description>Located on the Fern Lake trail this campground is adjacent to a large pile of rocks, hence the name. Located far away from the paved road, the trailhead is itself quite mysterious and severely lacking in signage. Everything about the campsite was rocky which unfortunately made taking a dump a bit difficult and requiring some ingenuity.
As there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much to do here thanks to the rocks, we decided to go on a dawn hike.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I had hiked in the Rockies in the Indian Peaks Park up to the Blue Lakes. It was more of a walk than a hike. 
Now we were headed to the Rocky Mountain National Park for four days of camping and backpacking. The Rockies themselves span thousands of miles in the US and Canada, and the Rocky Mountain National Park itself covers just a small portion of it.</description>

      <description>Of all my outdoors experiences I&amp;rsquo;ve perhaps never felt as alarmed as one evening in the Rockies.
 We woke up to find the entire world shrouded in a thin layer of mist and rain. As for the sun, not even a faint outline was visible anywhere. The first event to throw a wrench in our perfectly planned trip was the breaking down of our gas stove. No matter what the stove just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t light.</description>

      <description>&#34;The human race has to live with its conscience. Whatever the Hermians argue, survival is not everything.&#34; -Rendezvous with Rama  I&amp;rsquo;m biased towards space novels. Reading about space travel and stars and planets and contemplating the huge vastness and emptiness always fills me with a sense of indescribable wonder, bliss, and humility.
Arthur Clarke&amp;rsquo;s Rendezvous with Rama is a space poetry. It starts with a simple premise of an alien object (Rama) suddenly appearing in the solar system and humans venturing out to explore it.</description>

      <description>It is quite an everyday thing to be stuck in a plane on the tarmac at the Denver airport awaiting it&amp;rsquo;s turn to get on the runway. It is, however, not an everyday thing to have your plane bombarded by huge hailstones while it is there. At first it sounds like some firecrackers are going off in a distance, until you listen closely and realize that the sounds are coming from all over the plane, until finally you look out of the window to witness the scary sight of hail rendering your plane incapable of flying.</description>

      <description>It is my last afternoon in Golden, CO. I&amp;rsquo;m sitting by a window in a caf√© in the small downtown, staring out at the clouded skies, at the still air and the gently moving leaves.
Tomorrow I&amp;rsquo;ll head out from here and move over to another world. A part of me will stay back in Golden, watching the sun rise from beyond the rocks, lingering in the dorms and the classrooms and will get replaced with something different, hopefully better; and as the memory of all that we were fades, we&amp;rsquo;ll move on building our lives with the bonds we&amp;rsquo;ve created and the friendships we&amp;rsquo;ve made.</description>

      <description>&#34;As I approached my fiftieth birthday, I had become more and more enraged and mystified by the idiot decisions made by my countrymen. And then I had come suddenly to pity them, for I understood how innocent and natural it was for them to behave so abominably, and with such abominable results: They were doing their best to live like people invented in story books. This was the reason Americans shot each other so often: It was a convenient literary device for ending short stories and books.</description>

      <description>We were sitting at the far end of the pub, tired, exhausted, and relieved. I was slowly wiping the water that had condensed on the glass of my IPA with my fingertips, or was it a Belgian? We had conjoined two adjacent tables. The pub was playing some recent-old pop music, as usual. The lights were dim and yellow, there were television screens tucked in every corner airing sports to give people something to look at between conversations.</description>

      <description>In the opening scene of Nolan&amp;rsquo;s Prestige, Michael Caine explains what a magic trick consists of - a pledge, a turn, and the hardest part - the Prestige. This is what Asimov&amp;rsquo;s stories are like. He starts with an ordinary world with something slightly extraordinary about it, takes you around on a tour through the wonders of the world to distract you and slowly builds up the mystery in plain sight, until the big reveal in the final act.</description>

      <description>There is an official page on Active.com about what an unidentified charge of $79.95 on your bank statement means. How many such websites have you seen in your life? Here is a website that deceptively charges you hoping that you&amp;rsquo;re stupid enough to not check your credit card statement.

      <description>EDIT: Heeding my (and undoubtedly) infinitely many other complaints, the Canadian embassy has changed their agency from CIC to VFS who are genuinely good at their job. No complaints anymore.
Being an Indian means that I&amp;rsquo;ve to apply for a visa even for short visits when traveling internationally. This is usually a small loss of money and time and I&amp;rsquo;ve never had any trouble with this process. That was until I applied for a Canadian visa in the US.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t have much truth to express unless we have gone into those rooms and closets and woods and abysses that we were told not go in to. When we have gone in and looked around for a long while, just breathing and finally taking it in &amp;ndash; then we will be able to speak in our own voice and to stay in the present moment.

      <description>A cultured friend of fine, who owns an expensive Brompton Bike, once told me before moving out of Baltimore that the thing that he was going to miss the most about this city was the Baltimore Bike Party. Now, this is someone who I imagine brushes his teeth while listening to E-minor sonatas and who knows the difference between a lawn and a garden, not the kind of person who makes recommendations frivolously.</description>

Like all other Wes Anderson movies, Isle of Dogs makes no pretense of being serious or dark in any way. At the very start, there is a narrator who announces that this is a tale and introduces the story.</description>

      <description>Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a pro, it&amp;rsquo;s not possible to backpack for multiple days in the Big Bend. The desert conditions require you to carry all the water you need with you and you reach your limitations really fast.
But, there are plenty other ways to appreciate the Big Bend. I car camped at the Nine Point Draw and Stillwell for one night each, and then camped on the campgrounds at Chisos and Rio Grande Village for one night each.</description>

      <description>I reached the Chisos Visitor Center at 5, the place is nearly 5 hours from the nearby Midland airport. I had to hike up the Laguna Meadows trail and part of the Colima trail in 3 hours to avoid hiking in the dark, in order to join my friends camping at Colima 3.
This wasn&amp;rsquo;t the best idea I have ever had. Turns out distances look deceptively small on a map and with 2 days worth of supplies on your back every feet of elevation hurts and every switchback decimates you.</description>

When your work is complicated, involves serious teamwork, needs to be done in a time critical manner, is prone to errors of oversight; make a checklist. Follow it diligently, and upgrade it frequently. The purpose of a checklist is not to replace human thought, but to take care of the trivialities so that the mind can focus on more important things.</description>

      <description>Someone had gifted me this book as a kid, I do not remember who or when, I think it was my maths teacher.
I remember Hawking says in his book, that adding equations to books decreases their popularity. I remember not particularly liking this.
But I also remember reading, for the first time in my life, about light cones, about causality, about the big bang, black holes and their event horizons, entropy and the arrow of time, about Hubble&amp;rsquo;s discovery, the multitude of galaxies and the ever expanding universe, about the electrons with their dual natures and their half spins, bosons and fermions, Heisenberg&amp;rsquo;s uncertainty principle, Pauli&amp;rsquo;s exclusion principle, about supernovas and the creation of heavy elements, the spinning neutron stars, the Chandrasekhar limit, the spontaneous creation and annihilation of particles, the Hawking radiation, about quarks and their funny color names, about gluons, about the strong and weak nuclear forces, radioactivity, mesons, and muons, and pions, about quasars and gamma rays, about relativity and the space-time, the precession of mercury, the ultraviolet catastrophe, Einstein&amp;rsquo;s genius, about his folly, about mass and energy, the Planck&amp;rsquo;s constant, about gravitational lensing, about strings, about mirrors, about the vastness of the universe, and our place in it.</description>

      <description>It was the last day of the camp. All the campers were leaving out in busses and cars, being chaperoned off by the staff to the airport at various times during the day. As had been normal for quite a few days now (or was it weeks?), I had slept for 5-6 hours the previous night and yet was wide awake for my driving shifts.
In a comedy of errors, in the morning I had dropped a camper off whose parents had completely bungled up the departure plan.</description>

      <description>The running high is like having a prolonged orgasm.
I have a love-hate relationship with running. At the core of it, it is an extremely repetitive act, you&amp;rsquo;re doing one thing and one thing only, but then it is this simplicity of action that puts you in a trance. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, the time before you start running and the time at the beginning of the run are excruciating, there is just no rational reason to subject yourself to such a monotonous ordeal.</description>

Station Eleven jumps across three timelines - pre, post, and during the apocalypse - following the lives of three people who by a chance of fate are brought together momentarily and whose lives then diverge into the past and the future along a fragile web, their stories bursting out of a single moment in time.</description>

      <description>One of the most important lessons of Thinking, Fast and Slow is that our brains are unable to analyze real world data objectively. We alter our memories and retroactively modify our experiences to fit a story. The only solution to this is to keep records and to trust the data.
For me, the two most easily measurable resources are internet usage and money. After reading the book I was sure I wasn&amp;rsquo;t being honest with myself about these things.</description>

This is, in fact, true for almost all art forms. All good movies have those moments of stillness, all good conversations have those long spaces, most paintings have patches of featureless color, all novels have moments of long contemplation.</description>

      <description>I was attending the Science of Learning Symposium at JHU, which is usually quite fascinating, but was very boring this year. These are the things that frustrate me about formal events:
 People take extended time to introduce the speakers (nobody wants to hear you talk, go away). People in suits, usually senior professors who have stopped being scientists, who think they&amp;rsquo;re funny because nobody is honest to them, make shitty jokes and laugh at their own jokes.</description>

My power used to increase incessantly until I stopped growing and so I&amp;rsquo;ve probably paid a visit to an ophthalmologist every single year of my life in India. Today for the first time I went for an eye check-up in the US.</description>

      <description>These are some notes I took from the book Getting Things Done by David Allen. Let me first start with the cons of the book. First the book is tediously repetitive, while some repetition is good to drill the concepts deep in your mind, the book overdoes it. Second, the book is clearly intended for people who&amp;rsquo;ve white collar jobs, mostly managers and executives.
But that does not mean that you cannot gatecrash the party.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen Paddington, and frankly the only reason I decided to watch Paddington 2 is because of it&amp;rsquo;s insanely high ratings on Rotten Tomatoes.
The ratings are not exaggerated. This is a beautifully made movie, everything about this movie is good.
  I&amp;rsquo;ll only say this, watching this movie is not unlike reading a Harry Potter book (Hagrid is in the movie!). The story is tactfully written, as if by Rowling herself, but much more cheerful, without any hint of an underlying sadness.</description>

I resisted and just laid myself down on my bed staring at the ceiling. Perhaps for the first time I noticed how beautifully the walls of my house are painted.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;What happens when people open their hearts?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;They get better.‚Äù - Norwegian Wood
 Norwegian Wood is a teenage love story/coming of age story set mainly in Tokyo and the mountains of Kyoto. The name derives from the eponymous song by the Beatles.
I have very mixed feelings about the book. On one hand, the book has a very pulp feeling to it. There are too many sex scenes described with unnecessary details (the scenes aren&amp;rsquo;t even interesting, just teenagers jerking each other off) and every conversation between the protagonists eventually converges towards sex, love, and masturbation.</description>

      <description>Guillermo del Toro&amp;rsquo;s best work is undoubtedly Pan&amp;rsquo;s Labyrinth, a bittersweet dreamlike tale of a young girl who finds herself in the unknown forests of Spain.
This new movie of his, Shape of Water, in some ways tries to recreate the same feel. The premise is completely different but the setting is exactly as in Pan&amp;rsquo;s Labyrinth. There is an unfortunate damsel with evil parents/bosses who comes in contact with magical creatures and finds an escape from &amp;ldquo;reality&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>The Biscayne National Park visitor center is by the sea of course and is at the end of a serene Biscayne boulevard. There are sailing ships and motor boats marooned at the piers and the water is pristine blue. Close to the shore are the red mangroves trees, apparently the entire Biscayne National Park was a part of the Everglades not too long ago before the water levels rose. The waters right next to the shore are slow zones because apparently manatees (which are endangered now) like to congregate here and are likely to get damaged by careless boats.</description>

      <description>The next day I drove early morning to Shark Valley. This visitor center is at the center of what are called the historical Everglades but now it is practically the northern entrance. There is a single 15 mile biking trail at this visitor center. You can rent a bike for $9 per hour which is what I did. Along the way to Shark Valley you can see a lot of airboat tour advertisement which I was tempted to try, but because of the cold it was unlikely that I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to see much.</description>

      <description>An Area of Darkness is a disturbing pessimistic novel written by V.S. Naipaul about his first visit to India in 1962. This was India not too long after the Independence with it&amp;rsquo;s freshly minted Constitution, trying to make a transition from an English past to an Indian future. Naipaul shares the sentiments of West, the tone of the book is not unlike Slumdog Millionaire (a very unpopular movie in India).</description>

      <description>Thinking, Fast and Slow in a life changing book written by our lord and savior Daniel Kahneman, Danny Kanny.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read this book you should drop everything that you&amp;rsquo;re doing and start reading it right away. It is extremely well written and easy to read, with short chapters and lucid Hemingway-styled language lacking any pretentiousness.
Danny Kanny posits a two system model for our minds. The faster system which is also the system truly in charge, Mr.</description>

      <description>‚ÄúThe choice for mankind lies between freedom and happiness and for the great bulk of mankind, happiness is better.‚Äù - 1984
Icarus is a shocking film about an American filmmaker getting accidentally intertwined with head of the Russian anti-doping lab, Rodchenkov, during the unfolding of the Russian doping scandal. It starts out with the juxtaposition of Lance Armstrong&amp;rsquo;s testimonies before and after his conviction of guilt, and that sets the tone for the rest of the film.</description>

      <description>Goo watch Jumanji. I&amp;rsquo;ve now become a fan of Kevin Hart after watching this movie. There is no sarcasm, no deadpan humor, nothing vulgar, nothing GTA-Hangover style, nobody ever makes fun of anybody else, all the humor is benignly self-deprecating. It&amp;rsquo;s a heartwarming, wholesome, adventurous, gripping, innocent movie. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure nobody says fuck or shit in the movie even once. And it&amp;rsquo;s still funny. I know! Who would have thought?</description>

      <description>I love words.
I found this wholesome link on Reddit while I was doing some work (*cough*). As the US is riling under Mr. Pai&amp;rsquo;s proud accomplishments there are some countries that have figured it all out.
 Every year since 1944, the Icelandic book trade has published a catalogue ‚Äì called B√≥kat√≠√∞indi (‚ÄòBook Bulletin‚Äô, in English) ‚Äì that is sent to every household in the country in mid-November during the Reykjavik Book Fair.</description>

      <description>Zugzwang
 (n.) a situation in which the obligation to make a move in one&amp;rsquo;s turn is a serious, often decisive, disadvantage, often in the final years of grad school.
 Zugzywangy.
  I don&amp;rsquo;t understand music and yet I like to listen to it, same goes with girls. I recently came across this video on youtube where the guy describes chess games and it&amp;rsquo;s fun to watch even without knowing anything about chess.</description>

      <description>Boltbus, or as I like to call it capitalism on wheels.
I&amp;rsquo;ve bought a Boltbus ticket for $1 and I&amp;rsquo;ve bought one for $70, I bet there are derivatives being traded on these ticket prices. But all in all it&amp;rsquo;s always a pleasant ride, you know why? Because there&amp;rsquo;s a toilet on the bus. In India when you travel by buses you have to schedule each one your leaks and dumps.</description>

      <description>Saturdays are the hardest for me, I have an early morning yoga class. And so every Saturday morning there is almost always an intense battle between the sleep-a-little-more and the get-your-ass-up factions. Both sides have fairly convincing arguments and the debate turns deeply philosophical pretty quickly. Fortunately the get-your-ass-up faction always wins as by then I&amp;rsquo;m wide awake and can&amp;rsquo;t possibly go back to sleep. Nice strategy!
As I stumble outside half asleep half awake trying to make it in time, I&amp;rsquo;m pleasantly surprised by the small aimlessly drifting snow flakes, taking their time dancing in the wind before melting away on the wet pavement.</description>

      <description>One of the perks of being at Hopkins is that ever so often you get to visit the Hubble Space Telescope building. It is a stolid building perched atop a small slope on the fringe of the campus overlooking a dense park through which flows calmly a small ravine, or a run, as we like to call it in this part of the world.
There isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly much to see here, the telescope being in outer Space and all that, but there is a friendly cafeteria with large glass windows serving Central American food.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m usually very reluctant to try new places. I do enjoy the places AFTER I&amp;rsquo;ve been to them, the trouble lies with the planning phase. While there are several reviews available online none of them talk about, for example, how long does it take to get to Hopkins from the place? Or how sunny does it get at 3pm on a Sunday in December? None of the reviews, in short, provide any useful information to a graduate student.</description>

      <description>I spent the entire day today configuring Hugo so that I can write a blog. The alternative was of course using the free, efficient, easy to use, readily configurable blog sites. What be life without a little pain?
In my college I owned a shitty Acer laptop with an utterly useless battery and a cooling system so bad that the fan would act as a noise cancelling device for the din outside.</description>
