      <description>I love movies. I watch a lot of movies, I watch movies about movies, I watch documentaries about movies, I read articles about movies. Sadly I no longer have DC++ so I have to find other ways to do this, like actually going to theaters and paying money to watch.
If you think about all the movies that have come out in the recent times they&amp;rsquo;re either all crap or all very serious.</description>

 Every year since 1944, the Icelandic book trade has published a catalogue – called Bókatíðindi (‘Book Bulletin’, in English) – that is sent to every household in the country in mid-November during the Reykjavik Book Fair.</description>

  I don&amp;rsquo;t understand music and yet I like to listen to it, same goes with girls. I recently came across this video on youtube where the guy describes chess games and it&amp;rsquo;s fun to watch even without knowing anything about chess.</description>
