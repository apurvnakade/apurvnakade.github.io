      <description>Never buy an Apple product which is not in stock. I made this mistake and it took over a month to get this Macbook Air and its not even the greatest model in the world. This would have been fine had they told me it was going to take a month to get the laptop, but instead every 3-4 days they would send me an email saying that for certain unforeseeable reasons the shipment is delayed but you should expect to get it real soon.</description>
