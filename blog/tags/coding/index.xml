      <description>I used to code before internet was something you could have at your home, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t even the next big thing. You had to go to an internet caf√© to look at yahoo and hotmail, so basically you didn&amp;rsquo;t. I read books about coding (remember Let us C?) and coded in Turbo C. If you needed to know what the functions are in a library, or why a certain error was popping up, you read the source code, what else could you do?</description>

      <description>I spent the entire day today configuring Hugo so that I can write a blog. The alternative was of course using the free, efficient, easy to use, readily configurable blog sites. What be life without a little pain?
In my college I owned a shitty Acer laptop with an utterly useless battery and a cooling system so bad that the fan would act as a noise cancelling device for the din outside.</description>
