      <description>It is quite an everyday thing to be stuck in a plane on a tarmac at the Denver airport awaiting it&amp;rsquo;s turn to get on the runway. It is, however, not an everyday thing to have your plane bombarded by huge hailstones while it is there. At first it sounds like some firecrackers are going off in a distance, until you listen closely and realize that the sounds are coming from all over the plane, until finally you look out of the window to witness the scary sight of hail rendering your plane incapable of flying.</description>

      <description>We were sitting at the far end of the pub, tired, exhausted, and relieved. I was slowly wiping the water that had condensed on the glass of my IPA with my fingertips, or was it a Belgian? We had conjoined two adjacent tables. The pub was playing some recent-old pop music, as usual. The lights were dim and yellow, there were television screens tucked in every corner airing sports to give people something to look at between conversations.</description>

      <description>One of the most important lessons of Thinking, Fast and Slow is that our brains are unable to analyze real world data objectively. We alter our memories and retroactively modify our experiences to fit a story. The only solution to this is to keep records and to trust the data.
For me, the two most easily measurable resources are internet usage and money. After reading the book I was sure I wasn&amp;rsquo;t being honest with myself about these things.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been spending a lot of time thinking about what I want to do with my life. Turns out this is a really hard question. The biggest difficulty is probably trying to understand what it means to do something with your life.
Right now I&amp;rsquo;m coming back from a dance meet-up with some old friends and new, a little tipsy and drinking some more, and a lot exhilarated from moving on the dance floor.</description>
