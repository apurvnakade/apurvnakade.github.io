      <description>Sherlock Holmes was perhaps one of the first non-school books I have ever read. My first books were goosebumps, nancy drew, hardy boys and then I graduated to Sherlock Holmes and LOTR.
I mostly read Sherlock in the summer, when I would have a lot of free time and would often be traveling to see my extended family in the hot and sunny rural India, where there would be no electricity and no TV.</description>
