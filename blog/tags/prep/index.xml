      <description>The first thing you notice upon landing in Florida is the weather. The Miami airport is very well designed BUT it lacks good markings. I could spot several other passengers getting confused over the airport direction signs and falling back onto their smartphones.
I did not have time to explore Miami tonight. I rented a car and drove over to my airbnb. The rental facility is conveniently connected to the airport by a train (San Diego should learn).</description>
