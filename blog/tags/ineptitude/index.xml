      <description>EDIT: Heeding my (and undoubtedly) infinitely many other complaints, the Canadian embassy has changed their agency from CIC to VFS who are genuinely good at their job. No complaints anymore.
Being an Indian means that I&amp;rsquo;ve to apply for a visa even for short visits when traveling internationally. This is usually a small loss of money and time and I&amp;rsquo;ve never had any trouble with this process. That was until I applied for a Canadian visa in the US.</description>
