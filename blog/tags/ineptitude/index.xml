      <description>Being an Indian means that I&amp;rsquo;ve to apply for a visa even for short visits when travelling internationally. This is usually a small loss of money and time and I&amp;rsquo;ve never had any trouble with this process. That was until I applied for a Canadian visa in the US.
The Canadian government (fucking idiots) has outsourced the visa application process to a third party. These people are fucking morons incapable of making a sensible website and having the most arcane methods of application.</description>
