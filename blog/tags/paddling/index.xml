      <description>My canoeing partner had mentioned the Biscayne National Park to me. Upon googling I found out that the park was right next to the Everglades and had a lot of trips that looked interesting. I was surprised that I had not come across these adventures before.
I booked my trips online (why can&amp;rsquo;t other parks allow this?). The snorkeling trip was not available here too because of the cold weather so instead I went a boat trip to a nearby island, which was pretty lame, and extremely unpleasant because of the cold.</description>
