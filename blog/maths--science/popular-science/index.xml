      <description>I was attending the Science of Learning Symposium at JHU, which is usually quite fascinating, but was very boring this year. These are the things that frustrate me about formal events:
 People take extended time to introduce the speakers (nobody wants to hear you talk, go away). People in suits, usually senior professors who have stopped being scientists, who think they&amp;rsquo;re funny because nobody is honest to them, make shitty jokes and laugh at their own jokes.</description>
