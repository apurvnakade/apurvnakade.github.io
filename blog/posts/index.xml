      <description>Zugzwang
 (n.) a situation in which the obligation to make a move in one&amp;rsquo;s turn is a serious, often decisive, disadvantage, often in the final years of grad school.
 Zugzywangy.
  I don&amp;rsquo;t understand music and yet I like to listen to it, same goes with girls. I recently came across this video on youtube where the guy describes chess games and it&amp;rsquo;s fun to watch even without knowing anything about chess.</description>

      <description>Saturdays are the hardest for me, I have an early morning yoga class. And so every Saturday morning there is almost always an intense battle between the sleep-a-little-more and the get-your-ass-up factions. Both sides have fairly convincing arguments and the debate turns deeply philosophical pretty quickly. Fortunately the get-your-ass-up faction always wins as by then I&amp;rsquo;m wide awake and can&amp;rsquo;t possibly go back to sleep. Nice strategy!
As I stumble outside half asleep half awake trying to make it in time, I&amp;rsquo;m pleasantly surprised by the small aimlessly drifting snow flakes, taking their time dancing in the wind before melting away on the wet pavement.</description>

      <description>One of the perks of being at Hopkins is that ever so often you get to visit the Hubble Space Telescope building. It is a stolid building perched atop a small slope on the fringe of the campus overlooking a dense park through which flows calmly a small ravine, or a run, as we like to call it in this part of the world.
There isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly much to see here, the telescope being in outer Space and all that, but there is a friendly cafeteria with large glass windows serving Central American food.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m usually very reluctant to try new places. I do enjoy the places AFTER I&amp;rsquo;ve been to them, the trouble lies with the planning phase. While there are several reviews available online none of them talk about, for example, how long does it take to get to Hopkins from the place? Or how sunny does it get at 3pm on a Sunday in December? None of the reviews, in short, provide any useful information to a graduate student.</description>

      <description>I spent the entire day today configuring Hugo so that I can write a blog. The alternative was of course using the free, efficient, easy to use, readily configurable blog sites. What be life without a little pain?
In my college I owned a shitty Acer laptop with an utterly useless battery and a cooling system so bad that the fan would act as a noise cancelling device for the din outside.</description>
