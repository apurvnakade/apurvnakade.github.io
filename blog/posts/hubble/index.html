      <td><p>One of the perks of being at Hopkins is that ever so often you get to visit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Telescope_Science_Institute">Hubble Space Telescope building</a>. It is a stolid building perched atop a small slope on the fringe of the campus overlooking a dense park through which flows calmly a small ravine, or a <em>run</em>, as we like to call it in this part of the world.</p>

<p>There isn&rsquo;t exactly much to see here, the telescope being in outer Space and all that, but there is a friendly cafeteria with large glass windows serving Central American food. As I sit here sipping my delicious chicken quinoa soup the caf√© folk are trying to rearrange the floor, moving the chairs right and left, trying to move some large trees across the room, not unlike a Charlie Chaplin movie, which I&rsquo;m enjoying from a safe viewing distance.</p>

<p>And while we go on with our mundane lives, our soup-sipping and our chair-moving, a few rooms away in a small server somewhere, data is being incessantly received from Hubble; images of some distant possibly yet unseen part of the universe, perhaps of a galaxy being born, of a blitzing supernova, a red-shifted quasar, a message from the Foundation. Sauron&rsquo;s unblinking eye in Space.</p>

<p>Some twenty odd years ago, when I was barely starting school, Hubble was sending down images of it&rsquo;s magnificent Deep Field. Almost every single blip and smudge in this is a galaxy, and this entire image fits within a dot the size of a pinhead in the night sky! Fortunately my brain cannot comprehend the grandness of this, neither in space nor in time, and I&rsquo;m but destined to forget promptly and carry on with my daily meanderings.</p>

<p>Where would we be without <a href="https://youtu.be/95Tc0Rk2cNg">youtube</a>?</p>
