    <td class="post"><p>In the movie <em>Am√©lie</em> there is this beautiful moment when Monsieur Bretodeau discovers a box from his childhood in a telephone booth, has a madeleine moment, breaks down in tears and decides to call his distant daughter. Set in black and white against <a href="https://youtu.be/7wCLK9iOPDw?t=30m23s">the beautiful piano of Yann Tiersen</a> there is Mr. Bretodeau with his greying unkempt hair, melancholy eyes and a furrowed brow; you walk with him on the cobbled streets of a French market, you reminisce about a real childhood that never existed, so unlike and yet not so distant from yours. There is a church bell ringing at a distance, a phone ringing much closer, you can smell the Sunday streets dampened by the morning dew.</p>

<p>As a kid I was taught to believe in reality, in the order of things. But that thread grows more tenuous every passing day. When I try to remember things from my childhood it is not my triumphs that come to mind, but the rainy days where I couldn&rsquo;t see the friendly Banyan tree lost behind a curtain of rain, I remember breaking my teeth at my grandmother&rsquo;s house, getting caned for misbehaving in class, I remember the stars, beautiful yet distant, I remember the smell of coconut oil my girlfriend used to put in her hair, I remember a lot of crying.</p>

<p>And I forget. As I walk to work every morning I forget. Why do we need to be reminded of our own humanity? I&rsquo;ve been reading Neil Gaiman&rsquo;s masterpiece, the Sandman, and I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about dreams. May be this is what dreams are, they are a truce between us and reality. It is that makes us human, conquerors and unconquerable, creators of our own reality, all that is untrue yet real, all that is transient yet everlasting, about living in a moment that spans an eternity.</p>

<p>Being human is being constantly torn, and yet surviving for a tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll leave you with this wholesome video if nothing else about the <em>willing suspension of disbelief</em>.</p>
