      <description>Already my friends are posting new year wishes on facebook, in the first half of the world the calendars have been renewed and a nascent year has taken it&amp;rsquo;s first breath.
I&amp;rsquo;m watching the planes take off at the Baltimore airport against the setting sun, the morning snow is still littered on the ground making half the hanger appear white.
My plane has elegantly attached itself to the gate, like a peck on the cheek.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s almost time for my New Year&amp;rsquo;s Florida trip, and of course it&amp;rsquo;s predicted to rain in a couple of days. But no rain can dampen my spirits. Even with the rains the climate looks tropically warm and welcoming. I&amp;rsquo;ve booked a ridiculously cheap airbnb ($20 per night!) in Florida City, if it rains I am going to just drive around leisurely in southern Florida.
This brings back memories of an old trip with a good friend from CMI where we went backpacking across Kerala, one of the southernmost states of India, also blessed with a tropical climate.</description>
