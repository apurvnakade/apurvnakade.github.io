      <description>National Parks are unique and absolutely amazzing, visit as many as you can while you are in the US no matter how much effort and money it takes.
 Look for ranger programs on the National Park websites. Rangers are very knowledgeable people who truly love the wilderness, there cannot be any better guides.
 Plan only half day&amp;rsquo;s worth of trips. Things go wrong all the time and it&amp;rsquo;s useless to overplan.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;There are no other Everglades in the world.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;The Everglades: River of Grass 
 I woke up at 5:45am, determined to make the most out of the first day of the year. It was dark and hazy outside when I started heading towards the Everglades on US-1. As you exit US-1 the traffic starts dwindling until you reach a long single lane street passing through the massive lush green South Floridian agricultural lands.</description>

      <description>Already my friends are posting new year wishes on facebook, in the first half of the world the calendars have been renewed and a nascent year has taken it&amp;rsquo;s first breath.
 Sunset at BWI   I&amp;rsquo;m watching the planes take off at the Baltimore airport against the setting sun, the morning snow is still littered on the ground making half the hanger appear white.
My plane has elegantly attached itself to the gate, like a peck on the cheek.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s almost time for my New Year&amp;rsquo;s Florida trip, and of course it&amp;rsquo;s predicted to rain in a couple of days. But no rain can dampen my spirits. Even with the rains the climate looks tropically warm and welcoming. I&amp;rsquo;ve booked a ridiculously cheap airbnb ($20 per night!) in Florida City, if it rains I am going to just drive around leisurely in southern Florida.
This brings back memories of an old trip with a good friend from CMI where we went backpacking across Kerala, one of the southernmost states of India, also blessed with a tropical climate.</description>
