      <description>Life is profoundly sad. It is filled with loneliness, with regrets, lost chances, sad memories, words you can never take back, friends you&amp;rsquo;ll never see again, fractured pieces of your Self floating across the ocean of Life.
But on the stage, you forget. You forget the profundity and the seriousness. You forget the consequences.
On the stage, you are performing. You perform so that you can smile, at yourself, in secret, at the one moment you once lived when you were a completely different person, or for once, truly yourself.</description>

      <title>Joy of Running</title>

      <description>The running high is like having a prolonged orgasm.
I have a love-hate relationship with running. At the core of it, it is an extremely repetitive act, you&amp;rsquo;re doing one thing and one thing only, but then it is this simplicity of action that puts you in a trance. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, the time before you start running and the time at the beginning of the run are excruciating, there is just no rational reason to subject yourself to such a monotonous ordeal.</description>

      <title>Know Thyself</title>

      <description>One of the most important lessons of Thinking, Fast and Slow is that our brains are unable to analyze real world data objectively. We alter our memories and retroactively modify our experiences to fit a story. The only solution to this is to keep records and to trust the data.
For me, the two most easily measurable resources are internet usage and money. After reading the book I was sure I wasn&amp;rsquo;t being honest with myself about these things.</description>

      <title>Blank Spaces</title>

      <description>When I was making this blog I fidgeted around a lot with the style, trying to make it look pretty but I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it right. Until I realized that what makes a lot of websites pretty are the blank spaces.
This is, in fact, true for almost all art forms. All good movies have those moments of stillness, all good conversations have those long spaces, most paintings have patches of featureless color, all novels have moments of long contemplation.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been spending a lot of time thinking about what I want to do with my life. Turns out this is a really hard question. The biggest difficulty is probably trying to understand what it means to do something with your life.
Right now I&amp;rsquo;m coming back from a dance meet-up with some old friends and new, a little tipsy and drinking some more, and a lot exhilarated from moving on the dance floor.</description>

      <description>I came home today from the gym all sweaty and smelly and quite content. As I threw my bags on the bed and settled down, I had a great urge to open up my laptop and check something online. Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been becoming increasing aware of this internet addiction that seems more and more unavoidable.
I resisted and just laid myself down on my bed staring at the ceiling. Perhaps for the first time I noticed how beautifully the walls of my house are painted.</description>
