  <div class="post"><p>I&rsquo;ve recently been spending a lot of time thinking about what I want to do with my life. Turns out this is a really hard question. The biggest difficulty is probably trying to understand what it means to <em>do something</em> with your life.</p>

<p>Right now I&rsquo;m coming back from a dance meet-up with some old friends and new, a little tipsy and drinking some more, and a <em>lot</em> exhilarated from moving on the dance floor.</p>

<p>There are two extreme contexts in which one can view oneself. There is the really wide perspective; where you&rsquo;re here for a finite amount of time, almost by an accident against all probabilities. And then there is the narrow one; where you have been presented with all these moments to live, every moment unique.</p>

<p>But it is hard to see either of these extreme views. Somehow we aren&rsquo;t accustomed to experiencing them day in and day out.</p>

<p>And then there are several other contexts which we live by instead, our families, our friends, our work, our society.</p>

<p>When I dance it frees me of these intermediate contexts, I&rsquo;m living the moment when I&rsquo;m dancing, and when I stop dancing I get detached from time and space, as if having an outer body experience. I sometimes get the same feeling when I&rsquo;m concentrating on a yoga pose, or when I&rsquo;ve been hiking in the wild for a while, or when I&rsquo;ve been working on a really juicy maths problem.</p>

<p>I love living these moments, for these are moments of great clarity.</p>

<p>And I think that in these moments I see an answer.</p>

<p>I want to create. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what I create, so long as it&rsquo;s beautiful. I think this is what I want to do with my life, I want to constantly create something beautiful.</p>

<p>This is why I love to dance, as every dance, however ephemeral, is a beautiful creation, a beautiful moment floating in time,</p>

<p>Created by me.</p>
