      <title>Giving a Math Talk</title>

      <description>I recently saw this fun video about the tension between clarity and mystery and the role of this tension in creating good design. It made me think about giving a math talk. I think the element of mystery is often neglected when one prepares a math class or just a math talk.
It is understood that unlike, say, in fiction, mystery is undesirable in mathematics. While it is good to have a bunch of unsolved problems to work on, we would very much like to know the answers to them.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;In the broad light of day mathematicians check their equations and their proofs, leaving no stone unturned in their search for rigour. But, at night, under the full moon, they dream, they float among the stars and wonder at the miracle of the heavens. They are inspired. Without dreams there is no art, no mathematics, no life.&amp;rdquo; -Michael Atiyah
 I finally finished my week long class on the ideas behind Galois&amp;rsquo; proof of why a quintic cannot be solved using radicals.</description>
