<p>Unless you&rsquo;re a pro, it&rsquo;s not possible to backpack for multiple days in the Big Bend. The desert conditions require you to carry all the water you need with you and you reach your limitations really fast.</p>

<p>But, there are plenty other ways to appreciate the Big Bend. I car camped at the Nine Point Draw and Stillwell for one night each, and then camped on the campgrounds at Chisos and Rio Grande Village for one night each.</p>

<p>One great way to clean yourself of the accumulated sweat in the sweltering sun of the Big Bend is to visit the Hot Springs. There is an unpaved road that takes you to the hot springs, just wide enough to fit a wide tired vehicle and adjacent to a cliff on one side and a valley on the other, perfectly designed for a dramatic plunge. I was so stunned to see such a narrow passage that I froze midway thinking I was in deep trouble, but then I saw an SUV come down from the other side and decided to go on cautiously with my eyes glued and my heart blasting.</p>

<p>The hot springs, in the Rio Grande village, themselves are very small, barely capable of fitting a dozen people, but they flow out into the Rio Grande river making the water there a nice combination of hot and cold. The river is very narrow with a very mild current and you can swim across it to Mexico as long as the Border Patrol does not catch you. I was just happily splashing around in the water when a few horses showed up on the Mexican side of the river!</p>

<h3 id="must-see">Must See</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Hot Springs</b> <br>
Best time to visit the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/bibe/planyourvisit/soakinthesprings.htm">hot springs</a> is in the evening when the air is cool enough to go in the water and you&rsquo;re done for the day and are looking forward to clean yourself up.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Nature&rsquo;s trail</b> <br>
This <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60733-d145841-Reviews-Rio_Grande_Village_Nature_Trail-Big_Bend_National_Park_Texas.html">trail</a> is adjacent to the Rio Grande Village campgrounds and so can be done in the night when it gets dark, very serene and green and right next to the river, and if you&rsquo;re lucky you might see some javelinas!</p></li>

<li><p><b>Boquillas</b><br>
<a href="https://www.nps.gov/bibe/planyourvisit/visiting-boquillas.htm">Boquillas</a> is a small town you can visit in Mexico if you have you Passport and Visa. The Little Boquillas restaurant there has the best tacos I&rsquo;ve ever had in my life.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Stillwell</b><br>
Located just outside the park, <a href="https://stillwellstore.com/camping/">Stillwell</a> is a primitive campground, meaning you can drive up to the campsite and camp right next to your car. Cost? Just $10. Best to stay here either on your way in, or on your way out.</p></li>
