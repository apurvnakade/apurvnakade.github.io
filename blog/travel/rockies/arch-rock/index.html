  <div class="post"><p>Located on the Fern Lake trail this campground is adjacent to a large pile of rocks, hence the name. Located far away from the paved road, the trailhead is itself quite mysterious and severely lacking in signage. Everything about the campsite was rocky which unfortunately made taking a dump a bit difficult and requiring some ingenuity.</p>

<p>As there wasn&rsquo;t much to do here thanks to the rocks, we decided to go on a dawn hike. We woke up at 4 in the morning and headed up towards the fern lake in darkness. It&rsquo;s very hard to judge time or elevation when you do not have the sun above your head. If it&rsquo;s any consolation there were no rains when we started out and it was comfortably cold so the climb up was very uneventful and cozy.</p>

<p>This changed drastically when we reached the Fern lake at the top of the trail. The wind picked up and we could visibly see water being carried away from the top of the lake. The drizzle started which turned into a full-blown rain, temperatures dropped and our raingear proved insufficient and too flimsy to cope up with the mischevious weather.</p>

<p>Awed, but slightly dejected that we could not stay longer, we decided to turn our backs to the wrath of the lake. My pants were completely drenched after a few minutes of walking. As the sky brightened we could see the green and blue wonder that lay all around us. The rain prevented us to see too far ahead, but whatever we saw was magnificent. The rivers we crossed were now blowing at a full blast, it was very reminiscent of the beautiful Indian monsoon.</p>

<p>The rains stopped soon as we reached our campgrounds and so did our chaotic and fleeting adventure.</p>
