<p>Already my friends are posting new year wishes on facebook, in the first half of the world the calendars have been renewed and a nascent year has taken it&rsquo;s first breath.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m watching the planes take off at the Baltimore airport against the setting sun, the morning snow is still littered on the ground making half the hanger appear white.</p>

<p>My plane has elegantly attached itself to the gate, like a peck on the cheek. The sky gets dark now, turning blood orange at the horizon, beautiful Baltimore sunsets.
The snow looks even more otherworldly now, an oasis of white in an otherwise dark world.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a small kid with tiny teeth frolicking around the airport, 14 month old says the mother.
It run arounds in circles and ever so often crashes onto it&rsquo;s mother.</p>

<p>The first thing you notice upon landing in Florida is the weather. The Miami airport is very well designed BUT it lacks good markings. I could spot several other passengers getting confused over the airport direction signs and falling back onto their smartphones.</p>

<p>I did not have time to explore Miami tonight. I rented a car and drove over to my airbnb. The rental facility is conveniently connected to the airport by a train (San Diego should learn). My airbnb is in a suburb of Miami, which is a little unfortunate, but good luck finding an affordable place in the city.</p>

<p>Fortunately for me there is a <em>Cuban bakery</em>, Pinecrest Bakery, close to my airbnb which is open 24 hrs :) I know where I&rsquo;m getting my dinners from now. Turns out their <em>Chicken Empanadas</em> is quite good and they have nice <em>cafe con leche</em>. The server does not speak any English and I end up with a wad of 14 single dollar notes. A day well spent.</p>

<p>I have to wake up at 6 am tomorrow for my canoeing trip, but there is no way I&rsquo;m getting a good night&rsquo;s sleep with all the new year&rsquo;s celebrations going on all over the city, oh well. I cannot see the fireworks I can at least hear them, that must count for something.</p>

<h2 id="the-plan">The Plan</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s almost time for my New Year&rsquo;s Florida trip, and of course it&rsquo;s <em>predicted to rain</em> in a couple of days. But no rain can dampen my spirits. Even with the rains the climate looks tropically warm and welcoming. I&rsquo;ve booked a ridiculously cheap airbnb ($20 per night!) in Florida City, if it rains I am going to just drive around leisurely in southern Florida.</p>

<p>This brings back memories of an old trip with a good friend from CMI where we went backpacking across Kerala, one of the southernmost states of India, also blessed with a tropical climate. We had no money and no plans, not even a smartphone, we did not know the local language and never bothered checking the weather, just a backpack and a map of Kerala. Now I&rsquo;m renting a car and have the whole trip planned out, it almost feels like cheating.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve 4.5 days to explore southern Florida. Assuming a favorable climate my current plan is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I land in Miami on the evening of <strong>Dec 31</strong>. I&rsquo;m a bit worried of the traffic, but since I&rsquo;m not staying in the city I&rsquo;m hoping to not get stranded.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Jan 1</strong> I plan to spend the first day of the new year in the Everglades, visit the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/ever/planyourvisit/coedirections.htm">Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center</a>, do a <a href="https://www.nps.gov/ever/planyourvisit/flamingo-trails.htm">few hikes</a> gradually driving towards the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/ever/planyourvisit/flamdirections.htm">Flamingo marina</a>, which apparently was screwed over by Irma. They also have very interesting <a href="https://www.nps.gov/ever/planyourvisit/calendar.htm?keyword=&amp;date_start=01%2F01%2F2018&amp;date_end=01%2F04%2F2018#">ranger guided programs</a>:</p>

</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>Jan 2</strong> is what I&rsquo;m most excited about, I plan to rent a Kayak and explore the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/ever/planyourvisit/canoe-and-kayak-trails.htm">Kayak trails of Everglades</a>, particularly the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/ever/planyourvisit/upload/9-Mile-Pond-Canoe-Trail-2.pdf">Nine Mile Pond Canoe Trail</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Jan 3</strong> I&rsquo;m planning to bike the <a href="http://www.sharkvalleytramtours.com/everglades-bicycle-tours/">biking trail at Shark Valley</a> and then spend the rest of the day exploring Miami. Possible destinations include <a href="https://www.timeout.com/miami/little-havana">Little Havana</a>, <a href="https://www.baysidemarketplace.com/">Bayside Market Place</a> and random art museums.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Jan 4</strong> is dedicated to beaches and blue waters. I plan to drive to Key West and snorkel at the coral reefs along the way there. Key West is supposed to have beautiful sunsets, something to look forward to on my last night.</p>

<ol>
<li>Midway between Miami and Key West is the <a href="http://pennekamppark.com/snorkeling-tours/">John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park</a>, need I say more. This needs reservations.</li>
<li><a href="http://robbies.com/">Robbie&rsquo;s Marina</a> another possible destination to chill out on the Keys. This one is more expensive and looks like a party place.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mallorysquare.com/">Mallory Square</a> is the place to watch sunset on Key West.</li>
</ol></li>

<li><p><strong>Jan 5</strong> I fly out in the evening. My only goal for this day is to have good Cuban breakfast and lunch somewhere on the Miami beaches.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;m probably going to have to shuffle things around because of the rains. But first I need to pack my bags and buy food for the hiking and kayaking trips, don&rsquo;t particularly like this bit. Fortunately there&rsquo;s a grocery store a couple of blocks from my house, good place to grab a lot of fruits and dried meat.</p>
