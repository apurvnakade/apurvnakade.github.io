      <description>A curved curve from Curveland 
When we think of curves we naturally think of them as having some kind of a curvature. A circle is curved but a line is not. Similarly for surfaces, a sphere is curved (and so is a cylinder) but a plane is not.
But, there is a subtle difference between the curvature of curves and surfaces. It is possible to take a string and form a circle out of it without stretching or compressing, but it is not possible to take a flat piece of paper and shape it into a sphere (but you can into a cylinder) without stretching or compressing.</description>
