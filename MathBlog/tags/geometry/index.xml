      <description>A curved curve from Curveland  When we think of curves we naturally think of them as being curved. A circle has some curvature where as a line has no curvature. Similarly for surfaces, a sphere is curved (and so is a cylinder) but a plane is not.
But there is a subtle difference between the way in which curves and surfaces are curved. It is possible to take a string and form a circle out of it without stretching or compressing, but it is not possible to take a flat piece of paper and shape it into a sphere (but you can into a cylinder) without stretching or compressing.</description>
